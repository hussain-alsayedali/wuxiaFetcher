# wuxiaFetcher
fetch chapters from wuxiaworld , change The url(make sure that replace the number with PlsChangeME) and add the starting chapter and the last chapter and run.


## How It's Made:
using fetch and cheerio to take the text from the site while looping. after that make it into text file.

**Tech used:** Javascript, nodejs, cheerio .

installed cheerio using nodejs. cheerio is a library that could parse html, which make it a perfect choice when scraping sites.

## Optimizations

maybe making a UI to it would make it better.
at the moment the user gives the start and final chapter. it would be better if the user just select the novel he wants and the script would make all the chapters from start to finish
## Lessons Learned:

i learent how to scrape sites using cheerio which seemed complicated at the start , but as i started it was alot easier than i thought.
