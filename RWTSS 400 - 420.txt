Chapter 400

'We are now inside the room of the dungeon core.'

Erchitu's telepathic message echoed inside William's consciousness as he made his report.

'Understood,' William replied. 'Stay there for the time being, we just finished beating the boss on the twentieth floor.'

After finishing his short chat with Erchitu, William urged his team to step up the pace. After the continuous battles they faced in the Goblin Crypt, William's Quick Shot Shepherd Job Class had increased its level and was now at level sixteen.  

They didn't focus on killing monsters, and prioritized going to the lower floors as fast as they could. Finally, when they reached the 30th Floor, William felt that something was off.  

They didn't meet any goblins along the way as they headed towards the boss room. He was expecting staunch opposition from the monsters once they arrived on the last floor, but so far, nothing blocked their way, which made William, and the rest of his team confused.

"Stay alert," William reminded everyone as they delved deeper on the last floor of the Goblin Crypt.  

In time, they finally arrived at their destination. A four-meter tall golden gate barred their path. This was the Boss Room and the final hurdle in clearing the Dungeon. William glanced at everyone in his group and they all nodded their heads in unison.

Ian and Wendy held their weapons firmly and Psoglav had already summoned its clone. The Angorian Ibexes and the Cercopes Monkeys had also prepared themselves for the last battle inside the Goblin Crypt.

William pushed open the gates and what greeted them was pitch black darkness. Even with his Dark Vision, William couldn't see past two meters in front of him. He summoned his wooden staff and took a step forward.

His party followed him inside with bated breaths. When the last Cercopes Monkey had entered the Boss Room, the two golden gates immediately closed. Darkness descended upon the party for a brief moment before the torches hanging on the walls flared up one by one.

William drew a deep breath when he saw the final challenge that he was about to face.  

Thousands of Hobgoblins--composed of Warriors, Hunters, Shamans, Berserkers, Hobgoblin Leaders, and a Hobgoblin Chieftain--appeared before their very eyes.  

William raised his head to look at what seemed to be an elevated platform at the very back of the arena and saw a Hobgoblin that was two and a half meters tall.  

It held a jeweled bronze staff in its hand and its light-green eyes glowed with power. William had fought a similar Hobgoblin in the Heavenly Domain, but this creature in front of him was vastly different from the one he faced.

It was as if it was more intelligent compared to other Hobgoblins, which made William very wary. Immediately, he activated his Appraisal Skill to check the Final Boss that he needed to defeat in order to conquer the Goblin Crypt.

-----

< Hobgoblin Witch Doctor >

-- Contracted Monster

-- Humanoid

-- Threat Level: S (Centennial Low)

-- Centennial Monster

-- Hobgoblin Witch Doctors are considered as one of the most powerful mages in the Hobgoblin World. They are Dual Element Casters which would be very hard to defeat unless you had protective gear that could resist curses and other mind-affecting spells.

-- They are highly intelligent creatures that will use anything to their advantage. It is advisable to fight them with strong and experienced warriors who have fought against them in the past. This will increase the chances of your party beating this monster with minimal casualties.

-----

'A contracted beast,' William frowned.  

This was the first time he had seen a Contracted Monster acting as a leader of a Monster Army inside a Dungeon. William was very curious to know how this happened, but he wasn't in the right environment to find answers.  

Right now, there was only one thing he needed to do and that was to… fight!

"Ian, Wendy, eat the Chocolate Lollipops I gave you earlier," William ordered.  

The two girls didn't question William's order and immediately took out and ate the lollipops that they had stored inside their storage rings earlier.  

William summoned Stormcaller and firmly gripped it in his hands.  

"Gate Open!" William shouted.

Several portals appeared behind his back and Fenrir, the Trollhounds, the Rainbow Birds, the Blood Eagle Scadrez, the Centaurs, the Crimson Cavern Wolf Spiders, five Black-Winged Panthers, and the Supreme Killer Koalas appeared inside the Dungeon.  

William summoned all the members of his King's Legion that were above Rank C in this fight against the thousands of Goblins that ranked from the peak of Rank D up to the Centennial Rank.

William's Quick-Shot Shepherd Job Class had 16 levels. Because of Gavin's blessing, each time the level of his Job Class increased, he would receive three skill points instead of two. This gave the Half-Elf a total of 48 Skill Points which he used to max out some of the skills in his Skill Tree.

Among the skills that were at their max level were…

-----

< Quick Shot War Art >

(Requires 10 Skill Points to Unlock)

(Active Skill)

-- Allow the Quick Shot Shepherd to Employ his own War Arts

-- The maximum number of War Arts that can be created is thirteen.  

-----

< Heroism >

(Requires 10 Skill Points to Unlock)

(Passive Skill)

-- When members of the Herd are fighting against opponents that are a Rank or several Ranks higher than them, all of their stats will increase by 50%

-----

< Shepherd's Blessing >

(Requires 10 Skill Points to Unlock)

(Active Skill)

-- The Shepherd may choose one blessing to bestow upon the entire Herd. Each spell gives a corresponding +20 Enhancement to their respective stats.

-- Only one blessing can be active at a time.  

-- Ox's Strength

-- Feline's Grace

-- Hawk's Splendor

-- Wolf's Cunning

-- Turtle's Wisdom

-----

< Beacon of Hope >

(Requires 10 Skill Points to Unlock)

(Passive Skill)

-- Every member of the Shepherd's Legion receives +50 Enhancement to all stats.  

-----

< Herd Immunity >

(Requires 5 Skill Points to Unlock)

(Passive Skill)

-- All members of the King's Legion gain all of the Shepherd's natural resistances.  

-- If the Shepherd has an immunity to status ailments or diseases, all members of the Herd would share this immunity.

-----

The three remaining skill points were added to his Beast Taming Skill.

< Beast Taming >

( Skill Level: 3 / 5 )

(Active Skill)

-- Throw an orb of light to any Beasts that can be tamed.

-- The chances of Taming will increase if the Beast is weaker than the Shepherd.

-- The chances of Taming will increase if the Beast has a good impression of the Shepherd

-- The chances of Taming will increase if the Beast is in a weakened state.  

-- Only applicable to Herd Type Beasts

-----

"Ox's Strength." William chanted and the members of his King's Legion suddenly had their Strength Stat increased by 20 points.  

This skill was only supposed to work for Herd type creatures. However, David and Issei worked together to upgrade the skill in order to allow William to buff his entire King's Legion, instead of limiting it to the members of his Herd.

The collaboration of the two Gods allowed William to make all the empowering spells in his skill tree to work with the members of his King's Legion as well.  

Another skill that had received an upgrade from the two Gods, was the Beacon of Hope that increases all the stats of William's Legion by an additional 50 points.

The Herd immunity was also another skill that made William's King's Legion very impressive. Since the Half-Elf had powerful resistances against Dark Magic and Mind Affecting Spells, the members of his Legion also benefited from this.  

Last, but not the least, was the Heroism Skill. This passive ability was probably one of the most amazing skills in William's Quick-Shot Shepherd Job Class.

This skill boosted all the stats of the members of his King's Legion by 50%. What did that mean? It meant that his already strong army would receive an additional boost if they were facing an enemy that was stronger than them.  

In this case, the Centennial Ranked Monster they were facing counted as a monster stronger than them. But, aside from this 50% boost, there was also an additional boost that came from his Basic Shepherd Job Class.

His first skill, Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, gives an additional +10 to all stats to the member of his Legion.  

His other stat boosting skill, Way of the Shepherd, gave a 20% increase to the stats of the members of his King's Legion as well.  

------

(A/N: To give an example, the stats of Chronos, who is one of the team leaders of William's Herd, would have these stats once all the buffs are applied.)

Name: Chronos

Race: Angorian War Ibex

Level: 40

Health Points: 47,600 / 47,600

Mana Points: 9,350 / 9,350

< Strength: 101 (+207)  >  

< Agility: 158 (+213) >  

< Vitality: 80 (+158) >  

< Intelligence: 50 (+137) >  

< Dexterity: 40 (+130) >  

Due to the additional buffs, Chronos had jumped from a Class C Beast to the initial stages of a Class A Beast. This incredible skill lineup would make any member of Wiliam's King's Legion Wolves in Sheep's Clothing.

-----

The stronger members of William's Legion also received these buffs, which made them more formidable. Psoglav had entered the Pseudo-Centennial Rank Category due to the massive boost in its own stats.  

The Demonic Dog laughed out loud as he faced the thousands of Hobgoblins as if they were five-year old kids waiting to get spanked.

William and the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor glared at each other before giving the order to attack. The two sides collided and the blood of friends and foes alike stained the floor of the Boss Room in a dark-red hue.


Chapter 401

William switched his Subclass to Ice Wizard and buffed all the members of his King's Legion with Ice Armor. Although they were already strong enough to resist the disparity in numbers, he didn't want to take any chances and bolstered their defenses as well.

After imparting the defensive buff to everyone, William jumped on Ella's back and charged through the thousand strong Goblin Army. His target was the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor that was busy casting enhancement spells on its army. 

Ironically, this particular Hobgoblin Witch Doctor's second elemental magic was Life Magic. 

Life magic specialized in healing and providing beneficial buffs to anyone, which made the thousand strong Goblin Army more formidable.

The only saving grace was that the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor had just recently reached the Centennial Rank and its pool of Mana wasn't large enough to give its entire army strong buffs. However, it was highly intelligent and focused its powerful buffs on the Elites of its Army, namely the Hobgoblin Leaders, Berserkers, Goblin Shamans, and Hobgoblin Chieftain.

The violent collision of weapons, horns, claws, fangs, talons, and magic erupted inside the Boss Room. 

William knew that taking out the greatest threat would ease the burden on his Legion. It was quite unfortunate that he couldn't summon the members of the Minotaur Tribe that were currently inside the room of the Dungeon Core, inside the other Goblin Crypt. 

A powerful barrier seemed to be in place which prevented this from happening.

William entrusted Ian's and Wendy's safety to the Black-Winged Panthers that were known for their all-around offensive and defensive abilities.

"I'm Rolling!" 

Kasogonaga's adorable voice was drowned out by the war cries of the Hobgoblins that were dead set on turning it into chopped tofu. Fortunately, the rainbow-colored Anteater was not a vegetarian and flattened everything that blocked its path.

Its protective scales were among the hardest scales in the world of Hestia, which had earned it the moniker of Rolling Calamity among its peers.

The Rainbow Birds cursed out loud as they used their lollipops to fire Magic Missiles to decimate the bulk of the Goblin Army. 

"Stupid Hobgoblins!"

"Sh*t faced, green-skinned p*ssies!"

"Fck off!"

They were the loudest beasts among William's Legion and their curses made all the Hobgoblins mad with anger. Because of this, their numbers were thinned greatly by the Hobgoblin Hunters that targeted them specifically because of their obnoxious mouths.

Fenrir and his pack of Trollhounds were at the very front of the battle, engaging the Hobgoblins in a deathmatch. Due to their powerful regeneration ability, they were able to stand back up even after being hacked repeatedly.

The most notorious fighters among William's party were none other than the Supreme Killer Koalas, that had turned into Giant Rabid Beasts, that ripped apart everything that was within the reach of their massive claws.

Their skin was very tough and even though there were dozens of arrows embedded in their bodies, their onslaught never stopped. 

If they could speak in Human Language, all of them would just say "Tis but a scratch" and continue their killing spree.

The Centaurs, on the other hand, used their amazing marksmanship and rained arrows upon the Goblin Army. William's buffs had also been applied to them and they had jumped from being Class C Beasts to Rank A Beasts.

Bastian and his comrades were very surprised by this additional boost in their strength. However, this was no time to consult William about it. They just focused on thinning out the Goblin Army with their long-ranged attacks.

Meanwhile, deep inside the Magic Crystal Cavern, Thor and Ragnar started to stir. 

Magical energies gathered inside their bodies like a whirlpool as their bodies glowed. Dia, who was sleeping beside her two brothers, remained asleep. She was not aware of the changes that were happening in her surroundings.

Ian and Wendy fought back to back while being guarded by the five Black-Winged Panthers. 

These magical beasts were some of the latest additions to William's Herd and their powers had also increased due to William's buffs. The Pantheress, whom William called Shalla, was the biggest Panther among the group. 

She had opted to accept William's invitation to join his Legion rather than leave the Thousand Beast Domain. 

The reason? The Pantheress had a feeling that if she let go of this opportunity, she would miss out on a lot of things. Although Black-Winged Panthers were generally solitary creatures, they had decided to stick together and form a group in order to survive inside the Hidden Valley where the entrance of the Undying Lands was located.

Because of this, they remained as one of the dominant groups in the hierarchy and none dared to mess with them.

Shalla also understood that she needed to make contributions in order for William to recognize them. Right now, her task was to protect the Half-Elves lovers, and she and her team of Black-Winged Panthers ensured that the two ladies were safe.

They used their wings that were as hard as steel to block the rain of arrows that were aimed at the two girls. The Panthers also went out of their way to block the Dark Magic Spells, that were aimed at William's lovers, with their bodies.

Due to the resistance that William had towards Dark Magic, these spells only left minor scratches on their tough, magical, bodies.

Ian and Wendy understood that William had assigned the Beasts to protect them, so they didn't charge into the center of the fray like William and the War Ibexes. They only fought at the front lines, helping the Trollhounds and the Cercopes Monkey to decrease their enemies' numbers.

Stormcaller rumbled in William's hand and icycle shards flew in the air. The Hobgoblin Chieftain, and Leaders who were guarding the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor clashed with William and his goats. 

'Go, Will,' Ella said as she stomped her hooves at the Hobgoblin Chieftain who brandished its scimitars at her. 'Leave these Hobgoblins to us. Take down their leader first.'

"Understood. Take care, Mama," William replied as he jumped off her back and charged towards the Contracted Monster that was surrounded by Hobgoblins on all sides.

(A/N: Yes. This is how Ella and William usually communicate. Outsiders only hear "Meeeh". So, are you an outsider or not? Kekekeke!)

Stormcaller shone brightly as lightning bolts emerged from its tip. William thrust his spear and blasted away the Hobgoblins that were blocking his way.

The smell of charred flesh permeated the air, but that didn't stop the Hobgoblins from closing the gap as they charged at William with blood-shot eyes. 

"Icycle Realm!" William roared and everything around him was surrounded in razor sharp icicle spikes that jutted out of the ground. 

The Icycle Realm is William's Territory spell. Similar to a Battle Domain, it allowed William to create a field of razor sharp icicles that would soon explode and turn into sharp projectiles that would pierce, slash, and cut anything they come in contact with, except for William and his allies.

The Hobgoblin Defenders screamed in pain as sharp icicles pierced their bodies. Using this brief lapse in their formation, William brandished his spear and cut their heads off from their bodies.

The Hobgoblin Witch Doctor pointed its gnarled fingers at William, while chanting a spell. William smiled evilly as he held the spear in his hands and aimed it at the defenders that had formed a wall in front of the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor in the distance.

"Quick Shot Shepherd Fourth Form…" William shouted. "Grand Bazooka!"




Chapter 402

A powerful explosion erupted from the tip of Stormcaller and blew away the Hobgoblins that had formed a wall to protect their leader. 

Due to the spear's elemental power of lightning, the Grand Bazooka was infused with the Lightning Element. All of William's Quick-Shot Shepherd skills have no elemental affinity. They were empowered by William's Aura.

It is similar to the cases where he had infused his weapons with aura to allow them to attack like a remote controlled weapon. 

William skidded a few meters away due to the recoil of this War Art, but his strong body prevented him from getting seriously injured. As soon as the smoke of the explosion cleared, several void arrows flew in William's direction which the red-headed boy dodged with ease.

He didn't waste this opportunity and used his movement technique to close the gap between him and the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor. 

Soon, the jeweled bronze staff and Stormcaller clashed against each other. To William's surprise, the staff actually managed to withstand his full-powered spear strike with ease. 

The Hobgoblin Witch Doctor slammed the end of its staff towards the ground, causing a magic circle to appear under its feet. 

From it, a two-meter tall, Black-Scaled Salamander emerged.

As soon as it appeared, it lashed its massive tail out at William, which the latter dodged by a hair's breadth. After its attack ended, it immediately released a scorching fire breath towards William as its second greeting.

The red-headed boy immediately backed away as he raised his hand to cast a five-layered wall of ice to block the Salamander's attack.

The walls of ice exploded, but it was able to cancel the fire breath, which gave the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor time to create spectral hands and a doppelganger of itself, which allowed it to cast a barrage of dark spells towards William whose Ice Walls had fallen apart.

William clicked his tongue as he dodged the volley of spells that forced him to once again distance himself from his opponent. 

The Half-Elf activated his Appraisal Skill to see the information of the summoned beast that made his battle more difficult.

< Black-Scaled Salamander > 

-- Fire Breathing Amphibian

-- Summoned Beast

-- Threat Level: Class A (Mid)

-- This Giant Salamander usually lives near active volcanoes because they prefer extremely hot regions to strengthen their bodies. 

-- They are able to swim and dive inLava that is hot enough to completely melt a Human's body within half a minute of submersion.

-- They are very aggressive creatures and will even fight their own kind when their territories are intruded upon.

-- Their bites are also very poisonous, so extreme care is needed when fighting against them.

'Just great,' William thought as he held Stormcaller in a fighting stance. 'This Contracted Beast sure has many tricks under its sleeve.'

Frankly, William was very impressed with the Master of the Monster that he was fighting right now. Clearly, the Salamander was the Contracted Beast of the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor, which was the Contracted Monster of its Master. 

The Half-Elf frowned as he briefly scanned his surroundings. Most of the Hobgoblins around him were being held back by Ella and the goats, creating a clearing for him to fight against the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor, without worrying about outside reinforcements.

If he had wanted to kill the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor, William would have definitely used his fatal techniques like Gaebolg to attempt to kill it, or at least, give it a serious injury. However, William didn't do that.

He was very curious about how a Contracted Beast was able to take command of the Monsters inside a dungeon. Also, Williams was also very curious to know the identity of the Master that had turned the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor into its servant.

Updated_at lightnov‎elworld.c‍om

William didn't know that the Witch Doctor that he was fighting was the same monster that had secretly attacked Wendy, Spencer, Brutus and Bruno during their Dungeon exploration. 

While the war between the Hellan Kingdom and the two Dynasties was underway, Kent snuck inside the dungeon and gave his pet plenty of resources. The contracted Hobgoblin Shaman used this opportunity to make its breakthrough, and evolved into the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor.

Kent was one of the captains of The Organization working under Conner and Calum. These two gave him the opportunity to spoil his pet, and increase its rank. With the Hobgoblin Shaman's help, he was able to collect slaves and sell them to Deus.

Kent's end-game plan was to use his pet to take full control of the Goblin Crypt and use it as his own personal Reserved Army that he could use whenever he wanted. The plan succeeded and the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor had become the Hobgoblin's leader.

Unfortunately, Kent was sent to the far away Kingdom of Freesia to capture the Royal Family once the Continental Spell had been invoked. Unfortunately, their victory was short-lived and they were forced to retreat due to the arrival of the Kraetor Empire.

William eyed the arrogant Hobgoblin Witch Doctor that was currently riding on the Black-Scaled Salamander's back. 

While he was thinking of a way to subdue the contracted beast that had summoned its backup, an idea popped inside William's head. He had long wondered if it was possible, but he hadn't put it into practice.

He had also forgotten to ask Sancus, The God of Contracts, if his idea was possible.

"Only one way to find out," William muttered as he narrowed his eyes. "Icycle Realm!"

A field of Icicles erupted from the ground and trapped the Salamander and the Hobgoblin at its center. A magical barrier enveloped the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor while the Black-Scaled Salamander endured the razor sharp icicles that weren't able to penetrate the scales of its body.

William used this opportunity to close off the distance and…

"Pocket Cube, go!" William shouted as he threw one of Magical Cubes that had been gifted to him by Sancus. 

The cube expanded its size and enclosed the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor which was still inside its own magical barrier. 

Visit to lightnov‎elworld.c‎om discover_new novels.

The cube immediately shrank in size as it flew back to Wiliam's hand. William grabbed the cube firmly in his hand as the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor tried to break free from its prison. 

William sneered at its futile attempt to escape. Sancus had given him a guarantee that any beast that was of the Centennial Rank and below would be captured without fail. What the Half-Elf wanted to find out was whether it was able to capture Contracted Beasts as well. 

He wondered if the runes personally inscribed by the God of Contracts himself could forcefully break the contract of others. 

Soon, the cube stopped shaking and stayed still in William's hand. 

William smiled evilly as he tossed the cube in front of him, releasing his newly acquired Hobgoblin Witch Doctor.

The Black-Scaled Salamander had a dumbfounded look on its face as it looked at its contractor. It could still sense the connection between the two of them, but something felt different.

"Tell everyone to stop fighting," William ordered.

The Hobgoblin Witch Doctor gave the Half-Elf an unwilling gaze before uttering a loud shriek which reverberated inside the Boss Room. 

As soon as the Hobgoblins heard this cry, all of them stopped fighting. The Black-Scaled Salamander also lowered its head in submission to its Master's order.

The battlefield quieted down as both sides stopped their attempts to kill each other. They all looked at the red-headed boy who had a scammer's smile plastered on his handsome face.

"It works! Hahahaaha! I'm so awesome!" William laughed out loud because his suspicion had been confirmed. 

The Half-Elf's joyous laughter resounded in the battlefield, which made both friends and foes alike look at him weirdly. 

William didn't care about the stares of everyone around him as he laughed out loud due to happiness. Along with ending the battle inside the Boss Room, William had also gained a powerful Hobgoblin Witch Doctor in the process.

You can_find the rest of this_content on the lightnov‌elworld.c‍om platform.

Not only that, he was also able to make hundreds of Hobgoblin Elites part of his King's Legion as well. With this, William's private army numbered in the thousands.

On that day, William's Thousand Beast Army had finally become a reality.




Chapter 403

After the great battle on the thirtieth floor, William, Ian, and Wendy, entered the room where the Dungeon Core was located. 

This was not the first time that William had seen a dungeon core because he had already dealt with two during the Dungeon Outbreak months ago. 

Following Takam's orders, he pressed the Ring of Conquest against the Dungeon Core of the Goblin Crypt. The core glowed brightly and illuminated the entire room. William closed his eyes because the brightness was too much for his eyes.

When the light receded, he found himself face to face with a man who seemed to be in his mid-twenties. The man had red-hair, and silver-gray eyes that seemed to be looking straight at him.

William was about to say something, but the man had beaten him into it.

"Welcome my son, or my daughter," the man said with a smile. "Forgive me, but I have no idea if you are a boy or a girl. All I know is that, if you are seeing me right now then you are definitely my child and Arwen's."

The corner of the man's lips raised a little as if he was fondly remembering his beloved. William's heart was beating wildly inside his chest. His initial suspicion about this dungeon expedition had finally become a reality. 

"I am your father," the red-haired man declared. "Maxwell Von Ainsworth, the one and only Dungeon Conqueror in the entire world of Hestia."

There was a brief pose before Maxwell continued his explanation. 

"As you may have already guessed, this is just a recorded message that I have left inside the Ring of Conquest," Maxwell explained. "The reason why I did this is simple. I want you to inherit my powers and become the new Dungeon Conqueror.

"I don't know how old you are right now, but since you are seeing this recorded message now means only one thing. You are strong enough to meet the requirements to become my rightful successor. There can only be one Dungeon Conqueror at any given time, but I found a way to bypass this rule."

Maxwell smiled mischievously as he winked at William. 

Seeing his father's playful behavior made William feel that the two of them would definitely get along if they were to meet in real life. Along with this realization, the Half-Elf felt sad because of the missed opportunity of being able to live as a whole family with his mother and father.

"I have transferred my power as the Dungeon Conqueror inside the Ring of Conquest, which has prevented anyone from acquiring this rare profession," Maxwell stated. "And now, I will bestow this hard-sought profession onto you. Although it isn't much, this is the only thing that I can give to you as your father.

"The Goblin Crypt was the very first dungeon that I ever explored when I was young and foolish. Have you met the Goblin Shaman? That bastard sure plays dirty!" Maxwell chuckled. "When I finally reached the twentieth floor and beat the Boss Monster, I came face to face with the Dungeon Core."

Maxwell crossed his arms over his chest as his expression became serious. 

"The moment I touched the Dungeon Core was the same moment that my life changed forever," Maxwell said. "That was when I acquired the power of the Dungeon Conqueror. However, I didn't have the strength, or the qualifications, to conquer the Goblin Crypt at that time. Because of this, I left my mark on the Dungeon Core before leaving the dungeon."

"Many years have passed since then, and I had forgotten to return and recapture the first dungeon that I had cleared. Instead, I captured other dungeons and they became part of my power. Fortunately, I forgot about the Goblin Crypt at the time, because, if not, I would not be able to give you this opportunity."

Maxwell raised his hand and the ring on William's hand glowed brightly. William felt an incredible surge of power enveloped his entire body before a series of notifications appeared on his Status Page.

< Dungeon Master >

"I come as one, but I stand in the tens of thousands!"

-- Adds an additional 50 points to all stats.

-- Increase the spawn rate of Dungeon Monsters by 20%

William took deep breaths as he reigned in the new power that he had acquired from his father. Maxwell simply stood still as if he was already expecting this to happen. Five minutes later, the red-headed man continued his explanation.

"Congratulations, you are now a Dungeon Conqueror," Maxwell said, his voice laced with pride. "As expected of my child."

Maxwell clapped his hands as if to praise William for a job well done. Half a minute later, he stopped clapping and a teasing smile appeared on his handsome face.

"Your first Dungeon is the Goblin Crypt, but it is only the beginning. Unfortunately, you won't be able to conquer another dungeon because of the limitations that I have placed in the Ring of Conquest. In order to break this limit, you need to travel to the Central Continent. Once you're there, one of my acquaintances will come find you.

"You don't need to look for him, because he will immediately sense your presence once you step into the lands where the true powers in this world congregate. He may not appear right away, because he is a stubborn bastard, but rest assured he will appear when he has determined that you have met the next requirement as Dungeon Conqueror."

Maxwell's image started to fade and William reached out his hand unconsciously in order to touch his father, whom he was seeing for the first time in his life.

"My Child, I don't know what kind of challenges you will have in the future, or the enemies you have to face, but know this," Maxwell said as William's hand passed through his body. "A Dungeon Conqueror never fights alone. We, Are, Never, Alone!"

Maxwell's powerful voice reverberated as his projection faded completely. However, there was one final message that reached William's ears as the pure-white-world crumbled into pieces.

"I come as one, but I stand in the tens of thousands!"




Chapter 404

"Arslan, what do we do now?" a pretty girl asked the teenage boy who was seated on top of a boulder.

Arslan sighed as he looked at the map in front of him. Surrounding him were over two hundred young men and women who were waiting for him to make a decision. 

They were considered to be the elite among the young generation of the Zelan Dynasty. However, against the might of the Elves, there was nothing they could do. 

"The capital and the four surrounding cities around it have already fallen to the Elves," Arslan said in a serious tone. "According to our friends that are staying in the North, the Elves seemed to be building a teleportation gate."

The faces of everyone surrounding him immediately turned grim. They were geniuses in their own right, so they fully understood what building a teleportation gate meant. 

"They plan to bring in more reinforcements?!" the pretty girl gasped. "W-What do we do now?"

This was the question of everyone who had followed Arslan, who was hailed to be the best prodigy of the Zelan Dynasty. This same prodigy gathered all of his acquaintances and escaped the capital which was now being controlled by the Elves.

In the beginning, they thought about helping their other friends who had been captured by the invaders. However, after a few skirmishes, their numbers had dwindled in size due to the Elves' superior strength in battle.

After a series of defeats, they escaped to the edges of their kingdom, and hid in a forest near the Hellan Border, where the Fortress that James had defended was located.

Arslan scratched his dark brown hair, as he looked at the map in front of him. They had already retreated far enough in the hope that they could organize a mobile army that could do guerilla warfare with the Elves.

However, after their first few skirmishes, they finally understood that the Elves outclassed them both in physical, and Magical prowess. The elves were also proficient in forest warfare, which made things very difficult for Arslan and his team of freedom fighters.

"Paul, you said that the Crown Prince left for the Hellan Kingdom, right?" Arslan asked. "Where in the Hellan Kingdom was he headed?"

Paul, one of the Prince's loyal subjects, stood up to answer Arslan's inquiry.

"Back then, I was with the royal guards who bought time for the Crown Prince to make his escape," Paul replied. "His Highness said, 'Iif I am able to escape the Elven pursuers, I will head to the Town of Lont located in the Hellan Kingdom'."

"Do you know it's exact location?"

"According to the Crown Prince it is found on the outskirts of the Western Part of the Hellan Kingdom."

Arslan rubbed his chin as he contemplated their next course of action. This was the first time that he had learned of the town of Lont and wondered why the Prince left to go to that place.

'There must be a reason why he decided to go there of all places,' Arslan thought. 'I guess we should meet up with His Highness first and think of a way to make a comeback.'

Arslan rolled the map and returned it to his storage ring. He then scanned the faces of the survivors who had resisted the Elves alongside him.

"I'm sure that all of you have realized it by now, but we don't stand a chance against the Elven Prodigies," Arslan said. "I hate to admit this, but they are stronger than us."

The teenagers around him reluctantly nodded their heads in agreement. This was the truth, and there was no use in trying to deny it. 

"Our Crown Prince had fled to this town called Lont," Arslan continued his explanation. "It would be best if we reunite with him and plan our next course of action. Do any of you have any objections?"

Arslan waited for someone to object, but a minute passed and no one said anything. After this brief silence, he nodded his head and gave out his order.

"Paul, go to--"

Arslan immediately dodged to the side as an arrow passed through the spot where he sat a while ago. 

"Everyone, follow Paul and retreat!" Arslan ordered. "Paul, I'll leave them in your hands. Find His Highness!"

"What about you?!" Paul asked as he summoned his short sword and shield to stand beside Arslan. 

Several whistling sounds echoed inside the forest as a storm of arrows rained upon Arslan and the other survivors. 

"I'll hold them back!" Arslan said as he created a dome of Earth to block the arrows aimed at them. "Go now! I'll buy you as much time as I can!"

Paul gritted his teeth as he ran, leading the other survivors with him. The other children looked back at their leader who had created a great wall of Earth in order to delay the Elves' advance.

The sounds of explosions resounded in the forest as Arslan fought tooth and nail against an Elven Platoon that was sent to look for their whereabouts.

The Elves had played a little game among themselves and made bets on which team would be able to catch Arslan and his subordinates. Due to their superior strength and abilities, they didn't even bother to call their comrades to assist them in capturing the freedom fighters.

Arslan, was at the peak of the Platinum Rank, and was a match for an Elven Prodigy. However, this was not a one on one battle. He was fighting against Thirty Elven Prodigies. 

The word fighting was an exaggeration. What he was doing was merely buying some time for his comrades to escape as he created a spiked wall of Earth to prevent the Elves from crossing over.

The sounds of explosions resounded on the other side of the Earthen Wall. Aslan, on the other hand, who had his hands pressed against the Earth, was sweating buckets. He was channeling all of his strength into keeping the wall from falling apart due to the Elven bombardment.

Ten minutes later, the bombardment stopped and the Earthen Wall collapsed. Arslan panted as he held two short swords in his hand as he faced the hateful Elves who had made his friends prisoners.

"Looks like we got lucky, Captain." A handsome elf whistled as he looked at Arslan. "We caught the Big Fish."

A delicate looking Elf Girl smiled as she appraised the sole Human teenager who was standing before them.

"Well, I guess his looks are above average in terms of Human standards. However, they are still not good enough," the Elf Girl said as ripples of Wind Magic formed around her hands. "Capture him alive. Commander Elandorr has given us strict orders to bring him back to the capital. You can break his arms and legs, but none of you are allowed to kill him."

""Yes!""

The Elven fighters grinned as they charged towards Arslan who had already taken a fighting stance. For them, this game of cat and mouse was a very entertaining way to spend their time in the Human lands.

They had grown bored because those who tried to resist them had failed miserably. Only Arslan and his band of freedom fighters were able to survive their repeated attempts to capture all of them in a drag net.

Arslan stood his ground, he knew that it was only a matter of time before he was captured. Even so, he was the type that wouldn't go down without a fight. When the first Elf came within his strike range, he unleashed the Earthen Trap he had prepared beforehand.

When he set up the wall, he had also prepared a nasty surprise for the arrogant long-eared brats who looked down upon the Human race.

An explosion followed by a cry of pain reverberated in the forest as Arslan's special ability, Earth Bomb, exploded upon the unsuspecting elf who had stepped onto it unknowingly.

The explosion decimated the Elf's entire leg and stained the ground in red. Arslan's victim screamed in pain and rolled on the ground, making the other Elves back away from him. Arslan stomped his foot and an Earth Spike pierced the screaming Elve's chest, which ended his life. 

"You Elves always talk about how superior you are to Humans," Arslan snorted. "In the end, the color of your blood is the same as mine."

Arslan then made a taunting gesture using the short sword in his right hand. "Whoever wants to die next, please, step forward."

The True Prodigy of the Zelan Dynasty raised his head in arrogance. Power gathered in his hand and feet as he prepared to fight the Elves with everything he had. Although he was outnumbered, the Elves had made a mistake in attacking their camp.

The reason why many people in the Zelan Dynasty hailed Arslan as its top Prodigy was not because of his strength, but his uncanny ability to predict his enemy's movements and place Earth Bombs in their path.

His Earth Bombs didn't radiate magic, making them difficult to detect even if someone used a powerful magic detecting artifact.

This made Arslan's Earth Bombs very lethal to his enemies. 

You can_find the rest of this_content on the lightnov​elworld.c­om platform.

This was why no one in the Zelan Dynasty wanted to fight against Arslan and his team during Group Warfare, because of his uncanny ability to place undetectable traps that were strong enough to kill anyone below the Platinum Rank. 

Several other explosions reverberated in the forest as Arslan and the Elves fought. It only stopped half an hour later when more than two hundred teenage boys and girls had safely left the borders of the Zelan Dynasty.




Chapter 405

Paul and the rest of the freedom fighters traveled for two days before they reached the Fortress that stood between the Hellan Kingdom and the Zelan Dynasty.

They didn't take the time to look at the tens of thousands of Crystal Statues because they had already seen plenty of them in their own Kingdom. Paul assigned his group to loot the Fortress for food, water, and other things that they could use on their trip to reunite with Prince Alaric, who was assumed to be in the town of Lont.

Luckily, there were still many horses in the stables, which they used to travel towards the West. All of them rode their mounts with a heavy heart knowing that Arslan had either been killed or captured by their Elven pursuers. 

A few days ago, when a single Elf scout found their base, hundreds of Elves gathered to capture them. If not for the fact that Paul's special ability, Eye of the Scout, had accidentally seen the hundreds of Elves, who were stealthily headed into their direction, they would have all been captured by now.

This was why Arslan decided to make an unwritten rule that at the first sight of even a single Elf, all of them would make a hasty retreat. They didn't know that the Elves had decided to treat their capture as a game and decided to spread out and search for them as platoons.

If they only knew of this sudden change in their pursuers' strategy, they might have stayed behind to help Arslan deal with the Elves that had discovered their last camp.

"Human scum!" the pretty Elf-Girl shouted as she kicked the chained Arslan on the ground. 

Although they managed to subdue him, Aslan still managed to kill eight Elves because of his lethal Earth Bombs that exploded without warning. 

They had journeyed using special means to return to the capital as fast as possible, but she was still feeling irritated because of the loss of her subordinates. This would reflect poorly on her record as a commanding officer and she might even get a demotion.

Arslan was chained using a special metal that prevented him from using his abilities. 

The Prodigy of the Zelan Kingdom had wounds all over his body, but they were not serious enough to be fatal. The Elves didn't even bother to treat his wounds to prevent him from recovering and finding a way to escape the chains that bound him.

Two more hours passed and they finally arrived at the palace where Elandorr was expecting their arrival. The Commander of the Elven forces sat on the throne where the King of the Zelan Dynasty used to sit.

Elandorr looked at the injured Human teenager with interest, while the other Elves looked at Arslan with hatred.

Try the lightnov‍elworld.c‍om platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.

"All alone, but still managed to kill eight Elven hunters, not bad," Elandorr said with praise. "Too bad you were born a Human. If you were an Elf, you would definitely be among the top elites that serve under me."

Arslan didn't say anything as he was forced to kneel on the ground. He didn't react to the jeers and taunts of the Elves who were also present in the throne room. 

Elandorr nodded his head in appreciation and made a gesture to one of his attendants. 

The attendant respectfully bowed to Elandorr and presented him with a wooden box. Elandor gave the attendant a brief nod before walking towards Arslan with box in hand. The Elven Guards who had been forcing Arlsan to kneel held his arms firmly as Elandorr took out the contents of the box and showed it to the Prodigy of the Zelan Kingdom.

"Are you familiar with this?" Elandorr asked in a teasing tone. He waved the black collar that was inscribed with Elven runes. 

The moment Arslan saw the slave collar in Elandorr's hand, he knew what was coming next. Because of it, he gathered all of his strength and tried to smash his head on the floor to commit suicide.

Unfortunately, Elandorr had already seen this coming and gave the Human a quick kick on his jaw which made Arslan world spin around him. Two more guards came to secure him in place as Elandorr placed the slave collar on the teenager's neck.

"Stop," Elandorr ordered. "From now on, you are not allowed to commit suicide. You are not allowed to escape, and you are also not allowed to hurt any Elves in any manner. Do I make myself clear?"

Arslan bit his lip as he tried to prevent himself from answering Elandorr's inquiry. However, the runes on the collar on his neck glowed brightly sending immense pain through his body. 

Even so, Arslan refused to yield, which made Elandorr, as well as the other Elves, admire his strength of will. 

"Not bad," Elandorr nodded in appreciation. "I've always wanted to meet the so-called True Prodigy of this Kingdom. I thought that all of the praise they had for you was mere exaggeration. I guess, there is some truth in their words as well."

Blood dripped down Arslan's lips as he kept his mouth shut. He was enduring the excruciating pain that made him feel like dying, but he would rather die than submit to the Elves who had treated the Zelanians like grass that they could weed out whenever they felt bored.

Even though the Elven Princess had said that such an act was not worthy of a Superior Race like the Elves, many of the Elven Elites still tortured and beat up the survivors of the Kingdom behind closed doors.

New_chapters are published on lightnov​elworld.c​om

This was their way of making the Humans understand that they were simply rags that the Elves could keep or dispose of at their leisure. This excessive amont of torture and beatings had made the survivors lose all hope. In the end, the majority of the survivors had chosen to act servile to the Elves instead of choosing to be beaten to death. 

What happened to those who refused to acknowledge the Elven Rule? Those who had refused had either been killed in public executions, or sent to prison to receive humilation and torture.

Naturally, these public executions were held when the Elven Princess was away from the capital to inspect the other Human cities that had fallen under their rule. These public executions were witnessed by all the survivors in the capital because those who refused to participate would suffer the same fate.

After seeing several executions, the desire to rebel against their invaders had long disappeared in the teenagers who had chosen to become slaves of their own free will. The Elves didn't have an infinite supply of slave collars. Elandorr chose to only use them on special people, like Arslan who had fallen into his hands.

He didn't need to waste his limited number of slave collars on the children and teenagers who had chosen to submit to their rule out of hopelessness and desperation.

This was the tactic that the Elves had used in order to make the Human children submit to them. 

Elandorr glanced down at Arslan who was still refusing to submit to him even with the power of the slave collar. He was about to give the Human Prodigy an order when the door of the throne room opened.

The Elven Princess, Eowyn, entered and looked at the injured, and kneeling, Prodigy on the floor. Eowyn knew that she was only a supervisor and had no right to get in Elandorr's way. This was why she just looked at Arslan with a sad expression and didn't say anything else.

"Welcome back, Your Highness," Elandorr greeted Eowyn with a smile. "You should have told me that you were returning. I would have escorted you back to the palace personally."

"Thank you, Commander Elandorr." Eowyn nodded. "I apologize for coming at the wrong time."

Elandorr smiled brightly as he walked towards Eowyn. "Princess, you can come and see me anytime. I was just enslaving this Human because he committed a crime punishable by death. However, since you didn't want senseless killings, I decided to just enslave him."

Eowyn stared at Arslan whose body was trembling every now and then due to the pain he was experiencing. 

"What did he do?" Eowyn inquired.

Visit to lightnov​elworld.c‎om discover_new novels.

Elandorr gave the Human a side-long glance before shifting his attention back to the beautiful princess. "He was the leader of the rebellion and has killed many Elves. Just today, he killed eight elves before he was captured on the outskirts of the kingdom. He is truly a very troublesome individual."

Eowyn frowned. Although she was a pacifist, hearing that Elves died at the hands of the young man made her impression of Arslan change. 

No matter how good her heart was, she was still an Elf and they were her people. 

"What do you plan to do with him, Commander?" Eowyn asked.

"Whether he lives or dies will depend on Her Highness' wishes," Elandorr said with a carefree smile. 

At first Eowyn wanted to order Elandorr to execute Arslan. However, her teacher, Lady Arwen, had told her that violence was not always the answer to resolve disputes. After a brief inner struggle, Eowyn sighed and gave her verdict.

Elandorr seemed half amused by the Princess' choice, but since he had plans on wooing her, he decided to agree. This way, the Princess would feel indebted to him, which he could use to form a closer connection with her in the future.

"Congratulations," Elandorr said as he used his foot to raise Arslan's head. "Our Princess has chosen you to become her manservant. Make sure to serve her well. I mentioned this earlier, but I will repeat it again. You are not allowed to harm her in any way. Also, you will risk your life to protect her when she is in danger. This is an absolute order."

The collar on Arslan's neck glowed brighter. Soon, Arslan fell to the ground, unconscious. He had reached his limits in resisting the power of the slave collar. Elandorr made a gesture for one of the Elven healers to take care of the teenager's injury before he invited the Princess to have lunch with him. 

Eowyn accepted Elandorr's proposal. She knew that the Commander had spared the Human slave because of her, and because of this, she felt obligated to return the favor. Elandorr smiled brightly as he held the Elven Princess' hand. 

If giving her a human slave would make her happy then he didn't mind sending more slaves in order to gain her good graces. After all, he was not content with just being the Commander of the Elven Race.

No. Elandorr's ambition was greater. 

What he wanted was to become the future King of the Elves. That way, not only would he rule the Silvermoon Continent, but all the lands that they had conquered as well.

Chapter 406

Inside of the Goblin Crypt in the Town of Hartlepool…

William stood still with his eyes closed. The words that his father had told him still reverberated in the core of his being.

"I come as one, but I stand in the tens of thousands!"

The red-headed boy pressed his hand over his wildly beating heart as an image appeared inside his head. 

A man stood proud on the back of a Chimaera Type Dragon with black horns and wings spread wide. He had his arms crossed over his chest as he looked fearlessly at the massive army that belonged to the Demon Race in front of him.

Suddenly, several portals appeared behind him. Resounding roars and shrieks pierced the air as Dragons, Ancient Beasts, and other Behemoths descended on the battlefield with fury. More portals appeared around Maxwell as a fearless grin appeared on his handsome face.

Thousands…

Tens of thousands…

Hundreds of thousands....

Millions…

The sky darkened as Maxwell's Army of Dungeon Monsters poured out from the massive portals en masse. It was as if he was summoning all the monsters in the world to fight for him.

The Demon Army momentarily stopped their advance as the countless Dungeon Monsters roared simultaneously. 

It was at that moment when William understood why there could only be one Dungeon Conqueror to exist at a time. No army, kingdom, or empire, would be able to withstand an attack of this magnitude--dozens of Myriad Beasts, hundreds of Millennial Beasts, thousands of Centennial Beasts and other strong monsters that were Class B and above. 

The scene made William's blood boil due to how awesome it was. Frankly, the word awesome was an understatement. Words couldn't describe the feelings that were rising inside his heart.

Maxwell turned his head to look at William. There was a playful smile on his father's face as he gave him a brief nod.

Soon, an earth-shaking roar resounded across the battlefield as the massive Monster Army charged towards the Demon Army.

William watched as the Dragons rampaged in the sky.

He watched as the Eight-Headed Hydras fired Dragon Breaths of different elements from all of their heads. 

He watched as Giants brandished their weapons left and right, sending Demons flying in all directions.

He watched until the Demons sounded their bugle horns to signal their retreat.

The Monsters didn't waver and pursued relentlessly as their enemies retreated like the tide. 

William breathed a long deep sigh before opening his eyes. 

His father had shown him the possibility that was waiting for him at the end of his journey. The Half-Elf clenched his fist as he made a vow to himself.

'One day, I will come and see you father,' William said in his heart. 'Till then, watch over Mother for me.'

It was at that moment when he realized that a delicate hand held his arm and a pair of anxious eyes looked straight at his own eyes.

"What happened?" Wendy inquired. "The dungeon core disappeared after you pressed the ring against it. After that, you stood in a daze and no matter how much we tried to wake you up, you wouldn't budge."

William patted Wendy's head to assure her that he was fine. "Let's go back. Our mission has been accomplished."

Wendy nodded her head and held William's hand. Ian gave the two of them some space as he followed behind them. This was her way of compensating Wendy for the time that she had spent with William inside his Spiritual World. 

William and Ian didn't need to say anything to each other. Both of their hearts were connected, so the red-headed boy understood what Ian was trying to tell him.

'Thank you,' William said through telepathy.

Ian smiled as he walked behind William. 'You're not getting any sleep tonight.'

'Is that a threat?'

Updated_at lightnov‌elworld.c​om

'Does it sound like a threat?'

The two bickered via telepathy as they exited the Goblin Crypt. Now that the Dungeon Core had merged with the Goblin Crypt inside the Ring of Conquest, the Dungeon in Hartlepool would slowly disappear over the passage of time. 

Although William felt sorry that the townspeople would lose a source of income, he didn't have the leisure to wait for the curse to be undone before he increased his private army. 

William, Wendy, and Ian returned to the Armstrong Duchy to report to Spencer that they were going back to the Northern Regions. 

Spencer made one last futile attempt to convince his sister to stay, but Wendy was adamant to stick to her boyfriend like glue. Naturally, William welcomed Wendy's company, which gave Spencer a headache.

In the end, Spencer finally agreed and even gave them one of the flying carriages that belonged to their Duchy. Instead of a Gryphon, the one that pulled their flying carriage was the Lamassu. 

As the Magical Beast soared towards the North, Wendy and Ian laid beside William on the comfortable bed inside the flying carriage. William hugged both of them as he discussed with the System what their next course of action should be.

According to the Dungeon Conqueror Job Class, William wouldn't be able to Conquer a dungeon as easily as he had the Goblin Crypt. However, that restriction didn't prevent him from adding another Dungeon to his Ring of Conquest.

Takam's second condition was for William to raise four Centennial Ranked Beasts. William understood the importance of this because right now, he lacked powerful allies that had the Centennial Rank and above.

Takam also added that although William should also increase the ranks of the Minotaur Race to strengthen his forces, the Four Centennial Rank Beasts should not be counted on their side. 

Erchitu was already a Millennial Beast, and the Lamassus were all Class A Beasts. Takam's condition stated that he didn't care where William acquired these four Centennial Beasts, but any beast from the Minotaur Race wouldn't be counted among the four. 

Although William found this second condition to be unusual, he didn't mind doing it because he wanted to form a strong force to contend with the enemies he was about to face. 

William checked his status page and found an empty slot right next to his Goblin Crypt. The very first dungeon that he had visited had now turned green, which meant that it was an ally Dungeon.

After merging the recorded Goblin Crypt with the real Goblin Crypt, William had unlocked the true power of the Ring of Conquest as well as the Hidden Ability Dungeon Conqueror. 

What was that power? It was the ability to randomly teleport to any Dungeon in the world of Hestia that would serve as a Dungeon that he could conquer next. 

This was a heaven-defying ability because it allowed William to practically travel anywhere and capture any dungeon he wanted.

'This Job Class is insane,' William thought. He was quite thankful that his father had prepared adequately to transfer this power to him. If this power landed in the hands of those who would use it for World Conquest then the chances of them succeeding were very high.

'Fortunately there can only be one Dungeon Conqueror at any given time.' William sighed in relief as he looked at the ring in his hand, that had accompanied him since he was a baby. 

It was the ring that had taken William inside the Goblin Crypt, and forced him to acquire the Shepherd Job Class. If not for the Ring of Conquest activating at that time, William might have spent his childhood living a carefree life free without facing anything dangerous.

The Half-Elf took a deep breath as he made his decision.

He planned to have the new Dungeon serve as the place for his Thousand Beast Army to increase their ranks, in preparation for the battle against Deus, the Elves, and the Undead Army that threatened the peace of his own Thousand Beast Domain. 

'So, I just need to activate the Dungeon Search ability, and synchronize it with the Ring of Conquest to make a connection to that dungeon. This way, I can allow my Thousand Beast Domain to access it as well. Am I right, System?' William asked.

< Yes. However, once a Dungeon is chosen, we can't remove it from the Ring of Conquest no matter what. Are you fine with this, Host? >

'Okay. let's do this!' William closed his eyes and used the Dungeon Search ability.

At the same time, the System synchronized with him and activated the Ring of Conquest.

< Activating Ring of Conquest! >

The Ring on William's hand glowed as a golden thread shot out from its center. It flew towards the window of the flying carriage and traveled North East.

Half a minute later, it crossed the border of the Southern Continent and headed out to the wide ocean. The System monitored the golden thread's trajectory as it searched for a random Dungeon that would be connected to the Ring of Conquest.

According to the System, William would be able to travel to that Dungeon no matter where it was located. Simply put, he could travel across continents and back if the Dungeon that the Ring of Conquest picked was on another continent.

Five minutes later, the empty slot beside the Goblin Crypt glowed as the new Dungeon was registered.

William looked at the form of the Dungeon that slowly materialized on his Status Page. It didn't take long before a Majestic City appeared in front of him. 

He read the bold blue letters that appeared above the picture of the new Dungeon and frowned. It was a name that he was familiar with and it was considered to be a legendary city back on Earth. 

You can_find the rest of this_content on the lightnov‍elworld.c‍om platform.

The notification of the System resounded inside his head as it proclaimed the name of the new Dungeon that they had acquired.

< New Dungeon Acquired! >

< Dungeon name: Atlantis >




Chapter 407

"Atlantis…," William muttered as he looked at the information of the new Dungeon that had been registered inside his ring of conquest.

< Atlantis >

-- In times long forgotten, there was once a legendary city known for its advanced culture and technology. 

-- Many tales abound about how this city disappeared from the face of the world. Some said that, due to its advanced technology, the city traveled towards new worlds and frontiers unknown to many.

-- Some said that it was submerged somewhere in the vast ocean… waiting for someone to discover it once again.

-- Countless people throughout the years have searched for this city born from Myths and Legends, but none of them were able to find it. Only its name and legacy remained, and even that, too, would also be forgotten in due time.

-- The City of Atlantis. The Lost Empire of a Forgotten World.

-- Difficulty Rating: SSR

-- Number of Floors: 100

-- Monster Types: Unknown

William felt anticipation as he finished reading the information of this ancient city. Deep down, he was looking forward to discovering the secrets that it held.

Wendy stirred in her slumber as she sleepily raised her head to look at William. 

"Our journey is still long," William said as he kissed her forehead. "Sleep. I'll wake you up when it's time for dinner."

Wendy sleepily nodded her head and kissed William's cheek before she closed her eyes to sleep once more. The battle inside the Goblin Crypt had made her, and Ian, very exhausted. 

It would take a few more days before they reached the North where William decided to stay for the time being.

The Half-Elf didn't want to disturb Est and Brendan while they worked to rescue the survivors on the outskirts of the Kingdom. Although he didn't know why Deus decided to withdraw quite a few of their forces from the Hellan Capital, William had a hunch that it was due to Conner's order to look for the Undying Lands, which was now inside his Thousand Beast Domain.

He wasn't worried about Est's safety because he had already briefed Brendan on what to do in case the members of Deus returned to take back their control of the capital. Also, Ezio was there to mentor Brendan as the latter underwent his Assassin Training.

Yes. William decided to make Brendan a Disciple of his Fourth Master, Ezio. This way, the Son of the Prime Minister's talents wouldn't be wasted. Also, having someone as capable as Brendan would become a big boost to William's private forces in the future.

William also decided to bring Ian and Wendy to train the Dungeon of Atlantis in order to help raise their rank and allow them to gain real battle experience. 

'I almost forgot the advice that Issei had told me back in the Temple of the Gods,' William thought as he opened the Familia option in his status page. 

< Familia >

< First Familia Member >

-- Ashera Dy Cordelia

-- Host is able to use Wave Rider Skill

-- Host is able to use Water Whip Skill

-- Host has acquired Familia Oversoul Skill

-- Increase +15 enhancement bonus to all stats

-- Synchronization Rate: 45%

William didn't stop there and accessed Ashe's personal information.

Name: Ashera Dy Cordelia

Race: Half-Nymph

Age: 16

Job Class: Spirit Fencer (Level 32)

After checking the information that he was looking for, William consulted the System to help him conduct an experiment.

< Host, you want to try adding a Subclass to Ashe's main profession? >

For more_novel, visit lightnov­elworld.c‍om

'Yes,' William replied. 'Can you test if it's possible?'

< Understood. >

< Connecting to the Familia Database… >

< Activating the Divinity of the King's Chess Piece and CPU Core.... >

< Connection established! >

< Subclass Integration Commencing… >

William waited patiently for the System to finish tweaking the Familia Settings using the power of the two divinities. He wanted to know if it was possible to bestow a Job Class that he currently possessed to Ashe to allow her to wield its power. 

According to Issei's theory, if this experiment succeeded, the Mermaid would be able to help William increase the levels of his other professions, while that class was equipped to her. 

Not only would William be able to increase its levels, but Ashe would also benefit from it because she would be able to wield the power of whatever profession William wanted to bestow upon her.

It didn't take long before William heard the familiar notification sounds of the System, announcing the result of their experiment.

< Ding! >

< Subclass Integration has been successfully added to the Familia Settings! >

< Host may now add any Job Class to his Familia Member and allow them to use its power. >

< Would you like to add a subclass to Ashera Dy Cordelia ( Yes / No ) >

William laughed internally as he planted a kiss on the sleeping mermaid's head. Ashe didn't react because she was a very deep sleeper. She was not aware that her lover was doing something behind her back that would benefit her in the future.

William looked at the Job Classes that were currently available to him with a serious expression. He wanted to give Ashe a compatible Job Class that would work well with her Spirit Fencer Job Class.

This way, not only would it strengthen his mermaid lover, he would also be able to increase the level of a Job Class that he was not currently using.

After careful consideration, William decided to give Ashe the Job Class Geomancer. However, he still hadn't met the requirements for this profession.

Visit lightnov­elworld.c‍om, for the best novel_reading experience

The Geomancer profession required the Fighter Job Class and Earth Mage Job Class at their max level.

Currently, William's Fighter Job Class was only at Level 30. He wasn't able to upgrade this Job Class to its maximum potential because he didn't have much time to train it before leaving Lont.

'System, set Fighter as Ashe's Subclass and split the Experience Point allocation to fifty-fifty.'

< Understood! >

< Subclass integration successful! >

Name: Ashera Dy Cordelia

Race: Half-Nymph

Age: 16

Job Class: Spirit Fencer (Level 32)

Sub Class: Fighter (Level 30)

William nodded his head in appreciation. This way, Ashe would be able to increase the level of her Main Class, alongside her new Subclass. 

Due to their experiment, Ashe had also gained the ability to gain Experience Points as a means to increase her rank faster.

Usually, people in the World of Hestia became stronger through real life battles, and the use of Beast Cores, Magic Crystals, and Spirit Stones, to increase their ranks. 

William felt sad because the only one that could benefit from the Familia Setting was Ashe. Because of the Bond that they shared with each other, the mermaid was recognized by the King Chesspiece as William's Familia Member.

William's only regret was that he had to wait until he came of age before he could add Wendy, and Est to his Familia as well. 

The requirements for the Familia Member were strict, so William was helpless against it. For now, he could only focus on increasing Ashe's Job Levels, while giving resources to Wendy in order for her to increase her own profession, which was Magic Lancer.

As the Lamassu pulling William's carriage headed towards the Northern Regions, Princess Sidonie and Morgana were also hard at work in the Kingdom of Freesia.

Now that she had arrived at the capital, the Kraetor Empire started to march West. Their target was to conquer the Anaesha Dynasty which was currently under the control of the part of Deus that belonged to Conner's Faction.

The Myriad Ant Queen opened her eyes as her ant soldiers prepared to battle. Although she was once the protector of the Anaesha Dynasty, she didn't bat an eye and rallied her army to answer her call. 

Her Master, Princess Sidonie, had ordered her to send her troops in a pincer attack in order to take control of the capital. 

This was the first battle where the Kraetor Empire and Princess Sidonie's Ant Army had collaborated to gain control of one of the four Kingdoms that had once held total dominion over the Southern Continent.




Chapter 408

"Big Brother!" Brianna jumped into William's arms as soon as he stepped out of the flying carriage.

William held the little loli in his arms and patted her head. "You shouldn't always do this. Your image of being the temporary Great Chief of the Northern Tribes will diminish if others were to see your current expression."

Brianna took a few steps back as she stuck out her tongue. William could only shake his head in helplessness as he helped Wendy and Ian disembark from the flying carriage. It took them three days to reach the Third Peak of the Kyrintor Mountains from the Armstrong Duchy.

"How long are you going to stay here, Big Brother?" Brianna asked after William and his entourage settled inside the living room of the Great Chieftain's residence.

"We will stay for a while," William replied. "There are some things that I must take care of before meeting with your Sovereign."

Brianna nodded in understanding. She knew better than to pry into the affairs of her Big Brother, especially when it had something to do with their Sovereign, that protected the entirety of the Kyrintor Mountains. 

"You can stay here for as long as you like, Big Brother," Brianna patted her chest with confidence. "I am the one that calls the shots here right now."

William smirked as he playfully rubbed Brianna's hair with his hand. "You sure talk big now, huh? Fine, I'll accept your hospitality and stay here for a while. By the way, how are the Tribes?"

"All of them have already relocated here. At first, they were reluctant to leave their ancestral lands. However, they changed their minds when I told them that it was the order of our Sovereign."

"... You sure know what words to say to your people."

Brianna giggled as she closed her eyes to accept William's act of spoiling her rotten. Prince Ernest sighed beside Brianna because he had already come to terms with his Fiance's and William's close relationship.

Ian and Wendy also didn't mind this show of affection because they understood that William only saw Brianna as a little sister and not as a lover.

"Oh, I almost forgot," William said with a smile. "Can you give us a room with a large bed? I'm planning to share the room with Ian and Wendy."

Brianna tilted her head as she looked at Ian and Wendy. She could understand why William would like to share the same room with Wendy, but she didn't understand why Ian would also join them as well.

'Am I just overthinking things?' Brianna thought as she nodded her head to acknowledge William's request. "We have a room just like that, Big Brother. It has a bed big enough to fit six people. Afterall, the Warriors of the Northern Tribes usually have two or more wives."

Brianna suddenly remembered the event that happened not long ago.

If William hadn't appeared in the Kyrintor Mountains back then, Brianna's uncle, Connal, would have married Princess Aila and a few other ladies from the different tribes after the Bride Selection Ceremony. 

Also, Brianna would have also been forced to marry the second Prince of the Anaesha Dynasty, who had been turned to ashes by William during their duel.

"I'll have your quarters prepared right away, Big Brother." Brianna stood up. "For now, I'll let you talk to Ernest. I'm sure that the two of you have many things to talk about."

Brianna didn't wait for William's reply and left the living room. She also ordered her maid servants to follow her as they prepared William's, Ian's, Wendy's, and Dave's lodgings. 

"You'd better take care of her properly, Prince Ernest," William said as he faced the Youngest Prince of the Hellan Kingdom. "I'll make you sorry if you make her cry."

Prince Ernest gave William a curt nod before asking about the affairs of the Hellan Kingdom. William didn't hold back any information because the Youngest Prince had the right to know.

Prince Ernest showed a rare expression of anger when he heard that his Big Brothers had been in cahoot with The Organization that was responsible for the war and the Continental Spell, that turned the adults into crystal statues. 

The Youngest Prince didn't doubt William's story because he knew that the Half-Elf wouldn't waste his time to fake a report just to frame his brothers.

"Where are they now?" Prince Ernest asked after a brief period of silence.

"They're no longer in the capital," William answered. "According to credible sources, The Organization took them back to their Headquarters. Right now, Est and the Son of the Prime Minister are handling the affairs of the Capital City of Gladiolus."

Prince Ernest nodded his head. He was quite familiar with the two people that William had mentioned.

"Brendan is very capable," Prince Ernest stated. "He was raised by his father to take his place the moment he retired from service. As for Head Prefect Est..." 

Prince Ernest's expression softened when he thought of the one that led the First Years of the Magic Division. 

"He is a good choice to lead the people in the absence of the Royal Family," Prince Ernest commented.

The Young Prince then looked at William with a serious expression before asking a question.

"Can I go back to the capital? Maybe I can help ease their burden," Prince Ernest asked. "My presence will also pacify the survivors. Although I am not as popular as my older brothers, the citizens will still recognize me as their Prince."

William rubbed his chin as he pondered Ernest's suggestion. It was true that having the Young Prince return to the capital would give the Citizens some peace of mind. After careful consideration, William told Prince Ernest that he would think about it.

The only reason why he didn't say Yes right away was because of the threat of The Organization. Although they had pulled back the majority of their forces from the capital, they could still return at any time, which might put Prince Ernest in danger.

Prince Ernest also understood this, so he didn't force this issue. The reason he proposed such a thing was because he was feeling useless. Brianna was currently responsible for taking care of her Tribe, while he, on the other hand, had nothing to do but accompany her.

This sense of helplessness, and not getting any news from the capital, was making Prince Ernest feel depressed. It was as if he was sent to a foreign land to act as a hostage, never to return to his own Kingdom again.

Nighttime inat Asgard…

Wendy opened her eyes and found herself in a familiar room. This was not the first time that she had a dream like this and had gotten used to it. Her face reddened in expectation as she waited for William and her adult self to do the deed.

What she didn't know was this night would be different from the ones she had experienced in the past.

William came out of the shower room with only a towel covering the lower half of his body. 

Wendy almost drooled when she saw the adult William's lean and toned body that still had a few water droplets sticking to it. This was the body of the man that had made her face turn beet red, countless times in the past.

"What's wrong?" William asked. "You're surprisingly quiet today?"

Wendy turned her head to look behind her, expecting to see her adult self, but what she saw was her own reflection in the full body mirror inside the room. She then turned to the side, expecting to see the Valkyrie Captain sitting on one of the chairs inside the room, but it was empty.

A dawn of realization fell on Wendy at the same time that William's hand caressed the side of her face.

"Are you sick?" William asked in a teasing tone. "Why are you acting so meek right now?"

Wendy's body shuddered as she immediately took a few steps back. She then raised a hand in an attempt to keep the silver-haired man at bay and prevent him from coming close to her. 

"W-Wait! Something is wrong here!" Wendy exclaimed. "Y-You've got the wrong Wendy!"

"What are you talking about?" William frowned. "What do you mean, I've 'got the wrong Wendy'."

"L-Listen! It's not what you think! I mean, I am Wendy, but I am not the Wendy that you are looking for!"

"... What nonsense are you talking about?"

"I mean, I am not the Valkyrie Captain Wendy that you married!" Wendy exclaimed. "I'm not her!"

A soft chuckle escaped the Silver-Haired William's lips. Of course he knew what Wendy was talking about. 

Although the hair-color he had right now was Silver, the one inside the body was none other than William who had used the power of his Incubus Job Class to enter Wendy's dream. 

He was curious to find out what Wendy was dreaming about right now, so he entered her dream to take a peek. To his surprise, he found himself in the same familiar setting where he would usually make love to the Adult Wendy in his dreams.

'From her words, this means that this is not the first time that she has been here,' William mused. 'Interesting.'

William watched as the Adult Wendy, who used to beat the crap out of him, looked at him with caution.

His goal was to only take a peek at Wendy's dream, but the current scenario opened up a possibility to him.

'What if…' William thought as he gazed at the beautiful lady in front of him. 'Well, I'll find out soon enough.'

William smiled sweetly and his smile made Wendy shudder. It was the smile of a Wolf that was about to eat a snow-white rabbit that had unknowingly wandered close to its lair. 

Clearly, tonight would be a different night for the two of them.

Chapter 409

(Disclaimer: This chapter contains scenes not suitable for children. You have watched enough H to know what's going to happen next. If you're not comfortable in reading scenes like this, feel free to skip this Chapter.)

"D-Don't come any closer! If you come closer I'll scream!" Wendy said as she backed into the corner of the room.

She was currently wearing a semi-transparent, black, one-piece night dress that covered her curvaceous body. The night dress made her want to bury herself inside a hole due to embarrassment.

When she had seen her adult self wearing this night-dress for the first time, she had secretly felt jealous because the Silver-haired William looked so happy when he saw her in that attire. She had also witnessed how the two shared a passionate night that lasted until four in the morning before they decided to stop their lovemaking.

Now that she was wearing the same night dress, and was in the body of her adult form, Wendy felt like she was about to get eaten whole. She had seen how capable the silver-haired William was in her dreams. 

Although she had looked forward to being embraced the same way, her heart only wanted her beloved Half-Elf and not the handsome silver-haired William in front of her. 

"Please, there is someone else that I love," Wendy pleaded. "I want him to be my first. I can't make love with you."

The Silver-haired man stopped walking and the teasing expression on his face disappeared. Wendy thought that the handsome man would not listen to her and continue to approach her if she let her guard down.

However, the man didn't move from where he stood. Instead he looked at Wendy with eyes filled with affection.

"I'm sorry for teasing you, Wendy," William said. "I didn't know that you loved me this much."

William waved his hand over his face and the adult version of himself appeared in front of Wendy. 

Wendy looked at the man's red-hair and the light-green eyes that looked back at her with love. The blonde beauty's eyes then stared at the semi-pointy ears that proved her lover's race, which was indeed Half-Elf.

"W-Will?" Wendy asked half hoping that what she was seeing was true.

"It's me," William replied. 

Wendy was about to go to him to give him a hug, but hesitated in the end. She didn't want to make a mistake, so she decided to ask questions first to confirm whether this was the Half-Elf she loved or was just a figment of her imagination.

"How old are you?" Wendy inquired.

"I just turned fifteen a few days ago," William answered.

Try the lightnov​elworld.c​om platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.

"You did?"

"Yes."

"Why didn't you tell me?" Wendy frowned. "Does Ashe know?"

William nodded. "She celebrated my birthday with me. She even got drunk and started to kis-"

The Half-Elf abruptly stopped his words, which made Wendy quite curious.

"Go on. Continue."

"Let's talk about something else."

William walked towards Wendy and pulled her into his embrace. Although he didn't mind talking about how proactive Ashe was in her drunken state, he didn't want to talk about other women in front of Wendy.

Owen, and the Goddess Eros, told him that talking about another woman in front of another lady would definitely lead to a bad ending. In order to prevent that from happening, William decided to take the lead and stir the conversation away from the topic.

Wendy tried to resist at first, but William's whispers of love in her ears made her resistance not last long. In the end the two sat on top of the bed, while hugging each other.

"Do you always have this kind of dream?" William asked. 

Wendy nodded her head as her face reddened in embarrassment.

"How often do you have this dream?" William inquired. He wanted to know if the frequency of Wendy's dreams of Asgard matched his own.

"At least twice a week," Wendy admitted. "However, after returning to our Duchy, the frequency of my dreams increased to four or five times a week."

Wend raised her head to look at William. "How about you?"

"Two to three times a week as well," William replied. "They started on the night I gave you my Lollipop."

"... The night where they did thirty rounds?" Wendy asked.

Try the lightnov​elworld.c‌om platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.

"Yes. I did it with her thirty roun… what? How did you know that we did thirty rounds?"

"... You did it with her thirty times?"

William suddenly felt a chill run down his spine as beads of sweat formed on his forehead. 

"A-At that time I thought that it was only a dream," William replied. "S-She pleaded that I make love to her while being tied to the bed."

Wendy snorted. Of course she remembered that scene. How could she possibly forget? It was a very memorable night for her. It taught her a lot of things about how lovers showed their affection to each other. 

The blonde beauty then held Wiliam's shoulder and pinned him down on the bed. "Even if that was only a dream, and the Adult me begged you to do it, you still made love to a different version of me. That is considered cheating. Do you plead guilty to your crime?"

"Y-Yes. I plead guilty." William didn't know why, but Wendy's current strength was similar to the strength of the Valkyrie Captain in his dreams. 

It was as if a mountain was pressing on his shoulders and he couldn't budge from her hold. 

Wendy knew that William wasn't at fault, but she wasn't able to stop herself from feeling a bit irritated because the adult version of her managed to make love to the boy she liked first. Also, the one thing that made her unable to forget that particular dream was the fact that William had done it thirty times!

She was about to nag at the boy when she felt something warm and hard poking her backside. Wendy turned around to see that the towel that had been covering William's lower body had been cast aside when she suddenly pinned him down.

Wendy looked at Little William who was standing tall and proud. It was as if it was challenging her to go thirty rounds with him.

The blonde beauty's face immediately blushed when she remembered that night of intense passion that had been locked away inside her heart.

"I'm sorry," William said as he placed his hand on the back of Wendy's neck and gently pulled her close to him. "I was wrong. I didn't think properly back then."

His lips pressed over Wendy's and the latter reluctantly returned his kiss. William coaxed his lover with soft kisses and words of love that made Wendy temporarily forget the crime he had committed.

The next thing she knew, she was lying on the bed with the Half Elf on top of her.

William's hands and lips wandered all over her body and it sent a shiver down her spine. The grudge and reasoning that she tried to hold on to melted away due to William's soft and relentless attacks that made her writhe in pleasure.

This was not the first time that William had made love to the body of the Adult Wendy in his dreams. However, this time, it was different. Although the body was not hers, the person inside it was the first girl who had confessed her love to him in this world. 

Updated_at lightnov‍elworld.c­om

The person that William had recognized as his First Wife.

William kissed, licked, sucked, and bit Wendy all over. He left his mark on his lover's body to affirm that she belonged only to him.

Wendy had long lost her strength as William used the skills he had learned from Owen and Lady Eros to bring the lady he loved to the peak of pleasure.

The blonde beauty's body trembled the moment the two of them became one. William was currently in his Incubus Class. The techniques he learned from the Goddess of Lust herself made Wendy's sweet and sensual voice reverberate inside the room.

"Will.. I'm scared," Wendy said as she wrapped her arms around William's neck. "I-I feel weird."

William momentarily paused as he kissed Wendy's lips. "Don't be scared. I love you, Wendy." 

Wendy looked at her beloved's eyes and smiled, "I love you too, Will. Please, make me yours."

With his lover's permission, William once again lowered his hips, building up the pleasure with each thrust.

Suddenly, Wendy's body shivered at the same time that William released his essence deep inside her. The blonde beauty could feel her beloved's seed filling up her womb and it almost made her lose consciousness due to its intensity.

A minute passed as William and Wendy panted for breath. Both of them didn't expect that their first union, inside a dream world, would be so intense that they thought that their spirits were leaving their bodies.

After regaining his composure, William looked down at his lover with a fiery gaze. Wendy saw the hungry look in her lover's eyes and her body trembled in fear and anticipation of what was about to come.

"You're not getting any sleep tonight," William declared.

Wendy sighed as she surrendered herself to the man she loved. 

Both of them knew that this was only a dream, but they didn't care. 

They didn't care that it would take them a few years before they gained the adult bodies that they had right now. What was important was that, tonight, they reaffirmed the love they had for each other, while they waited to come of age.

When that day came, William vowed that he would no longer hold back and make love not only with Wendy, but to all the women who loved him as well. 

But, for now, all of his attention was focused on the girl that had made him open his heart. A girl whom he would treasure for the rest of his life. Now and Forever.

Chapter 410

Ashe looked at Wendy who was sitting inside the big bathtub. The blonde beauty had a very satisfied smile on her face and was currently humming a tune as she soaked herself in hot water. 

"You seem happy today," Ashe said with a smile. "Did something good happen?"

Wendy giggled before nodding her head. She even gave Ashe a mischievous gaze which piqued the latter's curiosity. The mermaid also noticed that Wendy was like a changed person after she had woken up. 

Ashe could sense that the current Wendy was brimming with confidence and energy, which was quite different from how she had been just a few days ago.

'I wonder what happened?'

Ashe was genuinely curious about this sudden change in her friend's character. She also linked Wendy's current bubbly self to the Half-Elf who was currently inside the Thousand Beast Domain to take care of some important matters.

"What happened?" Ashe inquired. "Spill it."

"Not telling!" Wendy playfully stuck out her tongue as she dreamily closed her eyes. The events that had transpired inside the dream were still in her memory. Originally, she thought that she would forget about this passionate dream the moment she woke up.

She had told this worry of hers to William as they held each other after their passionate lovemaking. 

William smiled and promised her that he would ensure that she would remember the dream even when she was awake. Although she didn't know what William did, the events of what happened last night were very fresh in her memory.

In fact, she felt that she could recall this memory anytime, and the images would flow inside her head as clearly as the night they whispered words of love to each other. 

Ashe knew that she wouldn't be getting any answers from Wendy, so she decided to just interrogate William later. She had a nagging feeling that whatever was causing Wendy's radiant expression was something major.

'I will get into the bottom of this later,' Ashe vowed as she joined Wendy inside the bathtub. 'Whatever is making Wendy act this way, I want some of it as well.'

Inside the Thousand Beast Domain…

A sudden chill passed down William's spine as he checked the conditions of Dia, Thor,and Ragnar. 

"Mama, did you suddenly feel a cold breeze pass through here?" William asked.

"Cold breeze?" Ella tilted her head. "I don't feel anything."

"Must be my imagination."

"Make sure to take a hot shower later just in case. We are high up in the mountains, so it's natural to feel cold from time to time."

William nodded his head. Although his body was already strong, and he had Lily's lollipops to protect him from the common cold, he still thought that he should take precautions just in case there was something wrong with his body.

Try the lightnov‍elworld.c‎om platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.

He had visited the Thousand Beast Domain because there had been changes in Thor's and Ragnar's bodies. 

The stripes on Thor's body had become more pronounced as if they were real lightning bolts. Ragnar, on the other hand, had grown a little bit. He was now about the same size as Thor. Only Dia remained the same and there were no visible changes in her body.

"Do you think they will wake up soon?" William inquired.

Ella nodded her head. "Yes. I can tell that Thor and Ragnar are about to finish their growth phase."

"I'm worried about Dia. She's still in a deep sleep and I see no changes in her body."

"Don't be. Dia is fine. Her body is taking sufficient magical energy from the Magic Crystals. Perhaps, her next phase requires more energy, so no visible changes can be seen at the moment."

William scratched his head because he was not an expert in Magical Beasts. If Ella was telling him that Dia was fine then it must be true.

"Have you connected the new dungeon with the Thousand Beast Domain?" Ella inquired. "Chronos, Aslan, and the others are getting excited about their new playground."

William shook his head. "I'm still in the middle of relocating the Bestiary from the Goblin Crypt to the first floor of the Atlantis Dungeon. It is a very delicate process. According to my estimate, it will take at least six more hours before everyone can travel there."

Ella nodded her head in understanding. She didn't ask how William was able to do the things he was able to do because there was no need for her to ask him. David had already passed all the information he knew about William's Divinities to her, so she left him to his own devices.

"Mama, are you also excited to explore this new dungeon?" William asked. 

"Yes," Ella replied. "I think the other goats are also nearing their limit. Perhaps they will be able to evolve in a month or two."

William smiled, "I hope for that as well." 

Ever since the Wolf Tide, he hadn't raised any other goats again aside from the thirteen survivors of his herd. He made sure that they gained enough experience points so that they would become stronger and evolve just like Ella did.

The only dungeon that they had officially explored was the Goblin Crypt. William was looking forward to leveling up his Job Classes in order to prepare for the inevitable war that would come knocking on their doors sooner or later.

William bid Ella goodbye and left the Magic Crystal Cavern. There were many things that he had to take care of and one of them was the good news that he received from The System after waking up. 

After his passionate night with Wendy, the System had come across a very interesting development that made William extremely happy.

For some unknown reason, Wendy was registered as William's second Familia member. Although they did the deed inside the dream, William didn't expect that the King's Chesspiece would activate and register Wendy's name as part of his Familia.

This opened up new possibilities for William because it allowed him to add a Subclass to his First Wife Candidate, which would increase her battle prowess. Not only that, Wendy would also be able to use the Experience Points inside the dungeon to increase her Rank as well as increase the levels of her Job Class.

However, there was some additional information in Wendy's stats that made William feel like scratching his head in confusion.

Name: Wendy Cy Armstrong

Race: Human

New novel_chapters are published here: lightnov‍elworld.c‍om

Age: 16

Job Class: Magic Lancer (Level 28)

Subclass: None

Locked Prestige Class: Valkyrie 

(Requirements not met)

< Valkyrie >

-- Requirements to unlock Job Class

-- Soul Mate Skill

-- Imperial Lancer

-- Celestial Bloodline

William didn't know whether he should laugh or cry after seeing this hidden Prestige Class that Wendy could unlock once its requirements were met.

The Imperial Lancer was easy to understand, because it was the second stage of the Magic Lancer. However, he didn't know where he could get the Soul Mate Skill and the Celestial Bloodline that was also needed to unlock this Prestige Class, which William believed had a deep connection with Wendy.

'Asgard…?' William thought. 

At the beginning, he thought that the dreams were just dreams. But, now, he felt that he needed to keep an eye out for any developments that might happen in his dreams. 

Wendy's Hidden Prestige Class was a clear indicator that there was a deeper meaning behind the dreams they were encountering.

It was quite possible for Wendy to live her life without discovering this hidden power inside her body. However, since William had already discovered it, he would certainly do his best to help Wendy unlock this power inside her.

William exited the Thousand Beast Domain and returned to his room within the Great Chieftain's residence. He was just about to look for Wendy when he noticed Ian sitting on the bed.

"Are you finished with your tasks?" Ian inquired. 

William nodded. "There are still things that need to be done, but I am free for now."

Ian smiled and walked towards Will. "Since that is the case, can you explain to me what happened to Wendy? She's practically glowing today as if she had been injected with some kind of powerful serum that will keep her young and springy for years."

Follow new_episodes on the lightnov‍elworld.c‎om platform.

William's body stiffened when Ian transformed into her mermaid form and pressed her hand over her chest. Although he was wearing clothes, Ashe's hand rested directly over the gem embedded in his chest.

"I don't know what special serum you gave her, but I want some of it too," Ashe demanded. "Will, you can't play favorites. Are you going to give it to me? Or must I make you give it to me by force?"

Ashe's hands then wrapped around William's waist as she gave him a firm hug. Clearly, she had no intention of letting the Half-Elf go unless her demands were met.




Chapter 411

William started to sweat buckets as his mermaid lover demanded that he give her whatever special serum that he had injected into Wendy, that made the blonde beauty look so bright, and springy today.

"What's wrong?" Ashe inquired. "Are you saying that I'm not qualified to have it? Whatever Wendy can do, I can definitely do better."

William stared into Ashe's light-purple eyes before making his resolve. He lowered his head to whisper something in her ears that made the body of the young lady who was hugging him firmly shudder.

"Ashe, are you sure you want to do it?" William asked softly. 

William didn't know if he could recreate a dreamworld for Ashe, but he was willing to give it a try in order to meet his lover's demand. 

Ashe lowered her head and didn't say anything. William waited patiently for her answer because he didn't want to force her to do anything that she didn't want.

Finally, a voice that was barely audible escaped Ashe's lips.

"...wan… it."

Even with William's powerful hearing, he was barely able to understand the words that Ashe had just said. Even so, the redness that had extended up to the tip of Ashe's ears was more than enough to tell him what he wanted to know.

However, William still wanted to hear it clearly and coaxed the blushing mermaid to repeat what she just said.

"I want it." Ashe finally relented as she buried her head on William's chest. "In the eyes of the mermaid race, I am already your wife. It is only normal that we…"

Ashe wasn't able to finish her words due to embarrassment. Instead, she pounded William's chest with her closed fist in order to hide her bashfulness.

What she didn't know was that this gesture of hers only made her look more endearing in William's eyes. He wrapped his arms around her waist and whispered something in her ears.

Ashe then raised her head and stared at William's eyes. The Half-Elf nodded and lowered his face to kiss her lips.

The two of them were so lost in their own world that they didn't notice the door of their room opening. William and Ashe continued their passionate kiss, disregarding those around them. 

Only when their kiss ended, did they finally realize that they were no longer alone inside the room. 

Two pairs of eyes stared at the Half-Elf and the blue-haired girl who were holding each other in a firm embrace.

"Go on. Don't mind us," Wendy said as she chewed on some walnuts. 

She was currently seated on top of the bed and she was not alone. Sitting right next to her was Brianna, who was looking at William, and the beautiful lady that she had never seen before, with genuine curiosity.

"Big Brother, I didn't know that you were such a good kisser," Brianna praised. "Can you teach me?"

The adorable loli threw a grenade that could be interpreted the wrong way intentionally. Clearly, the little troublemaker wanted to see how her Big Brother, Wendy, and the lady in Wililam's arms would react to her innocent request.

William knew that if he agreed to Brianna's request, even in a joking manner, he would be sleeping on the floor tonight. He also felt Ashe's two fingers subtly shift on his waist and knew that he would be in a world of pain if he gave the wrong answer.

"Brianna, kisses are for adults," William said in a righteous manner. It was as if he was a monk who was free from worldly desires. "You are still too young. Save your kisses for when you grow older."

"Tsk!" Brianna clicked her tongue as she grabbed a walnut to eat. Her little prank had failed, so she decided to eat while looking at her Big Brother in a mischievous manner. However, the next scene that unfolded before her eyes made her drop the walnut in her hand to the carpeted floor, as her jaw dropped in surprise.

Ashe had reverted back to her boy form and looked at Brianna with a smile. She knew that Brianna was a person that William trusted, so she didn't mind sharing this secret with her. 

"Y-You are a girl?!" Brianna gasped in shock as she stared wide-eyed at Ian.

Ian nodded and pressed a finger over her lips. "Keep this as a secret. You understand, right, Brianna?"

Brianna hastily nodded her head in understanding. She was there when Princess Sidonie had interrogated Ian. Back then, she just thought that Wiliam and Ian only had a close relationship because he was one of William's Knights. She never thought that Princess Sidonie's accusation was spot on.

William felt Wendy's gaze and the latter was looking at him with a very sweet smile plastered on her face. He could tell that his first girlfriend wasn't the least bit bothered by the kiss that Ashe had shared with him. 

This change in Wendy's mindset surprised William. All of a sudden, she felt more mature in his eyes. The Wendy he was familiar with had a hidden inferiority complex that she had openly exposed to him.

He used to always assure her not to compare herself to others, especially to his fiance, Rebecca, because in his eyes, she was already very beautiful. 

Now, that same Wendy was looking back at him with confidence, knowing that William truly loved her with all of his heart.

'I guess she stepped into adulthood last night,' William thought as he approached his first lover to give her a kiss as well.

Ashe had already given her consent and William wanted to meet her expectations. The only question was, what kind of scene he would see when he visited her dream tonight. Although he wasn't sure of how far he could take the Incubus Job Class, he was willing to do some experiments in order to understand how the Dream World worked.

Somewhere in the Hellan Kingdom…

Conner surveyed the land from the sky, while riding a Gryphon. He was currently at the South Eastern Side of the Hellan Kingdom, looking for any signs of the dungeon that had vanished without a trace.

With the Oathkeeper Key in his hands, he was looking for any kind of reaction from the artifact as he did a systematic sweep over the ground. 

Ever since the Hidden Valley had disappeared, the majority of the members of Deus had split up to look for the signs of the monument that served as the entrance to the Undying Lands. Their comrades, who had accompanied Conner when he inspected the Domain, had assured them that it was a Domain filled with priceless treasures.

This information was enough for the members of Deus to take this mission seriously as they looked for the Hidden Valley in the territories that had been assigned to them.

Conner was getting agitated with each day that passed without results. It was as if he was presented with a very delicious dish from a high-class restaurant. However, before he could even take a bite from his plate, the waiter decided to take it away and clean up the entire table, without leaving anything behind.

This made Conner very depressed and his temper also grew by the day. After another day of fruitless labor, Conner decided to rethink his plans for the Hellan Kingdom. Now that the Kraetor Empire and Elven Armies had arrived, his plan to take over the entire continent was no longer possible.

In fact, he was quite pissed off on how things turned out the way it did. After all the resources he had spent, and all the years that he had planned to secure the Oathkeeper Key and activate the Continental Spell, the gains he got were abysmal.

The faces of his two colleagues flashed inside his mind. Conner cursed them inwardly because the two of them had taken advantage of all of his hard work, and conquered three of the four factions that ruled over the Southern Continent with very little effort.

The ridicule and contempt had been very evident in Berthold's and Alessio's eyes when they came to see him. How he wanted to gauge their eyes out at that time, but he held back because fighting the two of them at the same time was a very stupid thing to do. 

Conner felt very helpless. He understood that Alessio and Berthold would not spare him if they succeeded in conquering the Hellan Kingdom. He only had two choices and they were to flee or to fight against them.

The only reason why he was still hesitant to leave the Hellan Kingdom to its fate was the possibility of finding the Undying Lands after their relentless searching. His teeth ached at the thought of having his two acquaintances accidentally find the Hidden Domain after they took over the kingdom.

The only solace he had about all of this was that the Oathkeeper Key was in his hands. Berthold and Alessio weren't aware of the existence of the Undying Lands. Even if they were to find the monument by accident, they would just think that it was just a structure from the distant past. 

After pondering for a while, he decided to continue his search for the Hidden Valley for a few more days before returning to the Hellan Capital. He had already invested too much to find the Secret of Immortality that he was unwilling to give up in his search.

This gave Est and Brendan enough time to bring all of the survivors, who remained on the outskirts of the Hellan Kingdom, back to the Capital City of Gladiolus. 




Chapter 412

< Host. The Bestiary has been successfully relocated on the first floor of Atlantis. Also, the connection between the Thousand Beast Domain and the new dungeon has been successfully established. >

William was currently having an afternoon nap on Wendy's lap, when the System notified him of the successful connection between the Goblin Crypt, the Thousand Beast Domain, and the new Dungeon--Atlantis.

This allowed the members of his Legion to travel unimpeded to the new frontier that was waiting for them. 

Ian and Wendy still didn't know about Atlantis, and he was planning to tell them about it as well as show it to them as soon as the System finished with the initial preparation. Now it was done, it was time for him to share his secret to his two lovers who would not allow him to leave to go on a Dungeon expedition without taking them with him.

"There is something that I want to show you girls," William said as he propped himself up. 

"What are you going to show us?" Wendy asked.

Ian, who was drinking tea not far from them, raised her head to look at William. She had already seen a few of the Half-Elf's secrets. However, since William was saying that he wanted to show something to Wendy and her, it meant that it was something that she didn't know about before now.

William smiled and extended his hands to his two lovers. The two girls, in turn, held his hands firmly. Wherever William was going, they would definitely accompany him no matter what.

The scenery changed immediately as William teleported the three of them inside the Thousand Beast Domain. 

This was not the first time that Wendy had been to this place, but her surprise was still reflected on her face. When she saw William's personal army gathered around them.

The Giant White Ox, Erchitu, and the Minotaur Races stood on one side.

The Centaurs, who were already equipped with their bows, arrows, and lances, were standing at the ready.

The Angray Birds and Blood Eagle, Scadrez, circled around them waiting for the order to depart.

Mohawk and the Cercopes Monkeys sat on the ground while holding the Hollow Concrete Blocks in their hands.

Fenrir and his trollhounds had a look of excitement on their faces as they eyed the red-headed boy whom they chose to follow.

Kasogonaga and Psoglav were also present. The two of them definitely wouldn't miss the opportunity to tag along and see what the new Dungeon was about.

Ella and the rest of the Angorian Ibexes were also raring to go.

The new residents of the Thousand Beast Domain--namely the Black-Winged Panthers, Supreme Killer Koalas, Crimson Cavern Wolf Spiders--were also gathered to embark on this expedition. 

As for the Goblins? They were still inside the Goblin Crypt and waiting for William to summon them.

Wendy looked at this sizable force with awe and admiration. They were all the subordinates of her lover and it filled her with pride.

She was also very happy that William was willing to share his secrets with her. Wendy unconsciously tightened her grip on William's hand, and the latter gave hers a gentle squeeze that put her heart at ease.

"I gathered all of you today, because we will be exploring a new dungeon," William declared, as he let go of Wendy's and Ian's hands. "This dungeon has a Hundred Floors, and I'm sure that it will not be an easy task to clear all of its floors. However, I am confident that no matter how long it takes, we will be able to conquer it without fail!"

Cheers, grunts, howls, and shrieks of approval greeted William's declaration. He then waved his hand and a Giant Portal appeared a few meters away from him. It was a portal that led to the first floor of the Dungeon of Atlantis and the members of his Herd and King's Legion eyed it with anticipation.

"Everyone, let's move out!" William ordered. He then walked towards the portal holding Stormcaller in his hands. Wendy and Ian walked beside him like Shieldmaidens, accompanying their chosen warrior to battle.

The next to follow were Ella and the War Ibexes. They were William's Core Team Members and their role was to always be by his side.

Fenrir and the trollhounds were the next to cross through the portal. William had already assigned their positions in his Legion, and the trollhounds served as the vanguard of WIlliam's army. 

Next to enter the portal was the Minotaur race. They were William's heavy infantry that would charge at his foes and trample them under their feet. 

The Cercopes Monkeys and the Centaur Race followed afterward. They were the range units of William's legion that would attack their enemies from a distance. 

With a powerful shriek, Scadrez, along with the Angray Birds, entered the portal. They served as William's air support that would attack from the sky when needed.

The System had already informed William that the dungeon of Atlantis was a high-grade Dungeon. Each Floor was very spacious and even had a sky that allowed flying creatures to roam freely.

Visit lightnov‍elworld.c‎om for a better_reading experience

This proved that this Dungeon was definitely different from normal Dungeons like the Goblin Crypt that only had a high ceiling. 

Psoglav swaggered inside the portal with a smile. He was looking forward to the treasures that he would find within its depths. Kasogonaga, on the other hand, sat on Shalla's back--the lead Pantheress of the Black-Winged Tigers.

The leader of the Panthers was already acquainted with the little rainbow-colored Demigod and allowed him to mount her back as they joined William on this expedition.

The Supreme Killer Koalas and the Crimson Cavern Wolf Spiders were the last to enter the portal. They served as William's rearguard.

For the time being, William decided not to include the Goblins in this expedition. They were put on standby in case something unexpected happened. 

William didn't dare to underestimate the Dungeon of Atlantis. A Dungeon that had a hundred floors and was rated as an SSR Dungeon would definitely have a Myriad Beast as its final boss. 

The System also informed William that there was a low possibility that instead of a Myriad Beast, the final boss of the Atlantis Dungeon was a Pseudo-Demigod.

William agreed with the System's conjecture. Atlantis was a Legendary Dungeon. It was not far-fetched for a being of such power to be the top dog of a Hundred-Floor dungeon.

It reminded him of the Dracolich inside the Undying Lands who was also a Pseudo-Demigod. The only silver lining was that the Dracolich was imprisoned and would stay that way for a few more years.

William hoped that when that time came, he would be strong enough to fight against a being that had been alive since the Era of the Gods.

Chapter 413

William looked at the clear blue sky above him, for a brief moment before looking at the Marshland in front of him. 

Just like the System had informed him, the first floor of the dungeon was very spacious and extended for miles. 

The map in his status page was still shrouded in darkness, but it was slowly clearing up with each passing minute. 

Scadrez and the Angray Birds had split up in several directions to help explore the first floor of the dungeon. This allowed William and the System to identify the first batch of monsters that they were about to face.

When William saw the monsters that spawned on the first floor of the dungeon, he wasn't able to stop his lips from twitching.

The reason? He was quite familiar with this monster because it was the typical beginner mob in most RPG games.

"Slimes…," William muttered. "Blue Slimes."

William looked at the jelly-like creatures who were approaching them very slowly. He still didn't know their abilities, but if his guess was correct, these low-level monsters wouldn't pose much of a threat to them.

Fenrir and the trollhounds immediately charged forward to engage the slimes. The trollhounds bit them and the blue slimes exploded in their jaws like gelatin.

< Gained Exp Points: 1 >

William wasn't surprised by this outcome. Afterall, a single slime couldn't possibly give that much experience, especially to their current numbers.

So any experience points that the Half-Elf, his Familia, his Herd and the members of his King's Legion gained by killing monsters inside this Dungeon would automatically be shared by all of them.

"Go and explore the first floor," William ordered. "All of you group up in teams of four and above. If you find anything suspicious let me know."

The members of his King's Legion voiced their agreement and they formed their teams to explore the first floor of the Dungeon.

Ella stayed behind to accompany William, Ian, and Wendy. This was a new Dungeon, and she didn't feel safe leaving the Half-Elf behind.

When the four of them were about to choose a direction to head in, the System notified William that the exit of the dungeon had been found. 

Just as the name suggested, the exit of the Dungeon led to the outside world. It was different from the pathways or stairways that led to the second floor of the dungeon.

William didn't hesitate and led his group to where the exit was. The ones that discovered it were the Angray Birds as they flew around the skies of the Dungeon.

When William arrived at the location, he found a shiny teleportation gate that seemed to be untouched by the passing of time. He didn't know how old the Dungeon was, but the structure he was seeing in front of him looked so clean that it made him doubt his understanding of Atlantis.

Even so, he was curious to see what the outside of Atlantis looked like.

"Stay close to me," William said as he looked at Ella, Ian, and Wendy. "I don't know what is on the other side of this gate, but no matter what happens, let's stay together."

Ella, Ian, and Wendy nodded their heads in unison. 

William took a deep breath before taking a step towards the teleportation gate. Ella, Ian, and Wendy followed behind him.

After a brief moment of discomfort that could be felt right after using a teleportation gate, William, Ella, Ian, and Wendy found themselves standing on a structure overlooking a domed city that seemed to be submerged under the water. 

The water above their heads was as dark as the night, but the fishes that swam overhead glowed with their own source of light. 

This scene looked so surreal that the two ladies standing beside William weren't able to stop themselves from gasping in shock from the beautiful sight.

However, William felt the hairs on the nape of his neck stand on end because he sensed a powerful presence that was looking in their direction. 

At the same time, the glowing fishes scattered and swam away as if fleeing from something. With its source of life gone, the Ancient City was shrouded in darkness. 

New novel_chapters are published here: lightnov‌elworld.c‌om

Suddenly, Ian's body glowed as she transformed to her original form. Shock crossed over her face, but it only lasted for a short moment. Her beautiful face suddenly became expressionless as she turned around to face William.

"Who are you?" Ashe asked in a voice that didn't belong to her. "What are you doing in this place?"

The voice that came out of Ashe's lips sounded so ancient that it sounded very hoarse. It was as if the owner of the voice hadn't talked to anyone for a long time and it was finding it hard to form the words properly. Even so, it carried a sort of intimidation that demanded answers.

Right behind Ashe, a giant glowing red eye appeared in the darkness. This giant eye looked down on William as Ashe opened her lips to repeat her questions.

"Who are you?" Ashe asked. "What are you doing in this place?"

Ella looked up at the Giant Eye and gave it a glare. Immediately, the owner of the Giant Eye focused its attention on the goat standing beside the red-headed boy whom it was talking to. 

Half a minute later, it refocused its attention to William. This time, the voice that came out of Ashe's voice wasn't as intimidating as before. Nevertheless, it still demanded answers.

"My name is William and the lady you are possessing right now is my lover," William answered in a respectful manner. He could tell that this beast was very powerful, so making it an enemy was out of the question. 

"I would appreciate it if you didn't use her as a medium to communicate with us," William pleaded. "I'm sure that I have the ability to talk to you regardless of the language you use."

William didn't know how this creature was able to take hold of Ashe's consciousness and body. But seeing Ashe's expressionless face looking back at him made his heart ache.

The creature seemed to think for a while after hearing William's words. Moments later, it released its hold on Ashe, which made the latter lose consciousness. 

William hurriedly caught his mermaid lover and held her tight. He immediately created a pink lollipop and unceremoniously placed it inside her mouth. This was the only thing he could think of in order to cure whatever conditions Ashe might have suffered during her possession.

The System also scanned her body to check her vital signs. After doing several tests, it had assured William that Ashe had just lost consciousness since the readings of her body and mental states were all normal.

William sighed in relief as he held Ashe in a princess carry. He then stared at the giant red eye that continued to observe them from outside the dome of Atlantis.

In that dark and silent world, a series of clicking sounds reached William's ears. The beast was communicating with him using its own language, without relying on a medium. 

Due to William's skill, Wild Empathy Mythic, he understood what the creature was trying to say. However, he didn't answer it right away because he was busy looking at the information that was provided by his Appraisal Skill. 

< Leviathan >

After he finished reading its information, William felt that he was about to suffer from a migraine. He didn't expect that just by visiting Atlantis, he would come face to face with one of the most elusive Demigods that resided in the world of Hestia.




Chapter 414

After the series of clicking sounds ended, William raised his head to answer Leviathan's question.

"We appeared in the Dungeon by complete accident," William stated. "Because of this, we decided to see what was outside the exit of the Dungeon and ended up here."

The giant, glowing, red eye focused its attention on William. No one could lie to a Demigod, so naturally, the Leviathan was able to tell that William was telling the truth.

The clicking sounds returned as Leviathan asked another question.

"Our purpose here is to explore the Dungeon," William replied. "If His Excellency doesn't want us to wander outside the Dungeon and explore the city then we will obey His Excellency's instructions."

After hearing William's reply, Levithan fell silent. It was as if it was thinking of a way on how to deal with William and the intruders that had entered its domain. 

A minute passed....

Two minutes....

Five minutes…

After that short period of time, the clicking sounds return.

(You may only explore the city after you have cleared the 100th Floor. Until then, you are not allowed to set foot outside the Dungeon. I will kill anyone who tries to explore the city without my permission. Do I make myself clear?)

New_chapters are published on lightnov‎elworld.c‌om

"Yes, Your Excellency."

The giant eye narrowed its gaze and a beam of blue light fell upon Ashe. William tried to shield his unconscious love but the light passed through him. And bathed the mermaid's body in a blue light.

William immediately assigned the System to check what was going on, but the results that came out from its diagnosis was that nothing was wrong.

(She is under the curse of a powerful God. I planned to fully remove the curse from her body as compensation, but it is not possible. Because of that, I decided to grant her the ability to retain her true form whenever she is within the confines of Atlantis. Remember, none of you are allowed to step out of the Dungeon until you have cleared the Final Floor.)

Leviathan gave Ella a brief glance before swimming away. If it was only dealing with William, it wouldn't have even bothered to be polite. However, it was only a Demigod. If the Hidden Goddess beside William decided to come look for him later to seek revenge, it would be unable to offer any resistance.

This was why it compromised and compensated William for its reckless act of possessing someone important to him.

Ella watched Levithan go with a calm expression. She had no intention of making things difficult for both parties because the Demigod had already compromised. Also, there were certain restrictions that prevented her from using her Goddess Form frequently.

William was worried about Ashe's condition, so he immediately signaled for Ella and Wendy to follow him as they walked towards the teleportation gate that would lead them back into the Dungeon.

As soon as they stepped onto the first floor of the Dungeon, William communicated with his Legion, and told them that he would be returning to the Thousand Beast Domain. He forbade all of them from taking the teleportation gate that would lead them outside the Dungeon.

William didn't forget to mention his discussion with the Demigod. Because of this, everyone under William's command avoided the teleportation gate like a plague. The threat that came from a Demigod was no laughing matter. 

Everyone promised that they would just explore up to the Ninth Floor and wait for William to return before challenging the Dungeon Boss. William agreed to their plan because he also wanted to know the types of monsters that spawned on the first few floors of the Dungeon.

After relaying his orders, he returned to the Thousand Beast Domain along with Wendy and Ella. He didn't return to the residence of the Great Chieftain right away. Instead, he took Ashe to the Villa inside the Domain.

This was the house that William had bought from the God Shop to serve as his lodging area whenever he visited the Domain. Although the System had assured him that Ashe had just lost consciousness, he still wanted to check her condition personally.

Currently, Ashe was still in her mermaid form and there were no signs of her reverting back to her sealed form anytime soon. William pressed his forehead over hers and tried Synchronization, but it didn't work.

Ashe was currently in a very deep sleep and it was possible that the power that Leviathan had bestowed upon her was getting in the way of a successful Synchronization. Because of this, William decided to do the next best thing--enter her dream.

"I don't know when I'll wake up," William said to Wendy, who was looking at him anxiously, "but rest assured that I know what I am doing. And don't worry, she will be fine."

Wendy nodded her head, "Be careful."

She knew that William wouldn't allow anything to happen to them, so she didn't hold him back from what he was planning to do. 

William closed his eyes and activated his Incubus skill called Dream Walker.

This allowed him to enter a person's dream and manipulate it to a certain extent. However, he couldn't control the direction of the dream according to his wishes. What happened in Wendy's Dream World was a special case. 

They were already in their adult forms, so he didn't need to exert his abilities to twist the Dream World to accommodate his wishes.

William walked through a dark and long tunnel. He could see a bright light at its end. The red-headed boy walked towards it unhurriedly because the Dream Tunnel he was walking in wasn't very stable. 

The source of this_chapter; lightnov‍elworld.c‌om

If William were to force himself towards Ashe's Dreamworld, the connection might break and his second attempt would be twice as hard.

When William finally reached the end of the tunnel, he found himself standing in front of a clear blue lake. Before William could even look for his mermaid lover, he heard the sound of footsteps coming behind him.

William turned around just in time to see the Silver-Haired William walk straight through him. It was then when he realized that he was in an ethereal state. 

The Silver-Haired William walked towards the lake as if nothing happened. He only stopped when he reached the edge of the lake.

"I have come to take the test of Knighthood!" the Silver-Haired William declared. "I beseech you to bestow upon me a quest!"

His voice echoed across the Lake as he waited for a response. William frowned as he crossed his arms over his chest. He was surprised to see this adult version of himself in this dream, but since he was only a visitor, he couldn't do anything about it.

Naturally, he could materialize himself and make his presence known, but he chose not to do that. He had a nagging feeling that the girl he was looking for would appear soon. 

Just as he was thinking this thought, the clear and peaceful waters of the lake started to churn. Moments later, a beautiful woman with blue hair and purple eyes emerged out of its center.

William immediately recognized her as Ashe, the only difference was that she was in her adult form, just like the Valkyrie Captain, Wendy, in his dreams.

"Mortal who has just finished his coming of age ceremony, are you sure you are ready to become a Knight?"

The cool and proud voice passed through William's ears and made him look at this adult version of Ashe in a new light. The Ashe in front of him had a cold and aloof expression on her face as she stared at the mortal young man who was aiming to become a Knight.

"Yes." the Silver-Haired William. "Lady of the Lake, please, grant me a quest."




Chapter 415

The otherworldly beauty walked towards William with steady steps. She walked upon the water's surface as if she was walking on land. When she was only ten meters away from the Silver-Haired William, she stopped and raised a hand.

"If you were an ordinary mortal, I would have bestowed a simple quest upon you," Ashe said in that same cold voice that was devoid of feelings. "Unfortunately, you are no ordinary man. The bloodline of Pendragon flows inside your veins, so mundane quests would not be suitable for you."

"I will accept any quest that you will bestow upon me, Your Excellency."

"Very well, young Pendragon. Since it is a quest that you seek… a quest you shall get."

A water mirror appeared between Ashe and the Silver-Haired William. Soon, the image of an Elf, who seemed to be in deep sleep appeared on the mirror's surface.

"In the land of Alfheim, where the Elves reside, there is a girl that goes by the name Acedia," Ashe said cooly. "Your quest is to bring her to the Violet Ever Garden, where she will remain for the rest of her life. Once you accomplish this quest, you can return to me to receive your reward and my blessing."

The Silver-Haired William looked at the sleeping Elf in the water mirror and burned her image inside his memory. 

The Red-Headed William walked in front of his adult self and also looked at the mirror. There, he saw a sleeping Elf with very long golden hair that extended to the ground around her. 

The corner of WIlliam's lips twitched as he saw the Rapunzel-like Sleeping Beauty on the surface of the water mirror. 

You can_find the rest of this_content on the lightnov­elworld.c‍om platform.

For some unknown reason, he felt that the sleeping girl was familiar to him. However, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't recall who she was. 

Even so, the familiar feeling coming from the golden-haired girl, who was sleeping peacefully on a bed of roses, made his heart ache. He couldn't understand why he was feeling this way. Yet, William knew with certainty that he knew who she was.

While William was deep in his thoughts, the adult William inquired of The Lady of The Lake how he would get to Alfheim from Midgard. 

The red-haired William decided to put the issue of the sleeping elf girl to the side for the time being as he listened to Ashe's reply.

"Located in the East, deep within the Bridgefell Grove, lies an Old Oak Tree," Ashe answered. "It is the biggest and tallest tree in the forest, so you will identify it right away. On the ninth hour, of the ninth day, of the ninth month, a portal between Midgard and Alfheim will appear at the base of the Old Oak Tree.

"You may enter Alfheim through this passage. However, know that this passage only opens once a year. If you want to return to Midgard, you have to return on the ninth hour, of the ninth day, of the ninth month, and cross the bridge between the worlds once again."

The Silver-Haired William said his thanks and bid goodbye to the Lady who was looking at him with a cold expression. 

The red-haired William watched his adult self walk away as he rubbed his chin in thought. 

'Are these dreams perhaps connected?' William thought. 'Or is it just a coincidence?'

Asgard, Midgard, and now Alfheim. The three worlds that resided within the World Tree Yggdrasil were both familiar and unfamiliar to William. He had heard about them when he had learned a little bit about Norse Mythology, but his knowledge about it was superficial. 

He only knew about Odin, Thor, Freya, and Midgard. As for the rest, he had no idea at all!

"Fool."

An irritated voice passed through his ears and William hurriedly looked at the Lady of the Lake who was glaring in the Silver-Haired William's direction.

"You didn't even recognize me after I saved you from drowning when you were eight years old!" The Lady of the Lake's aloof expression broke down as she gnashed her teeth in anger. "Back then you said you would marry me, but after ten years, you've completely forgotten about me. I knew that Humans couldn't be trusted! All of you are thick-headed fools who only know about chivalry and fighting. I hope your head gets kicked by a donkey!"

After saying a few more curses the Lady of the Lake returned to the depths of the water. The lake once again returned to its peaceful state as if the earlier event hadn't happened.

William scratched his head because he was at a loss on what to do. The dream was coming to an end and the world was turning blurry. This meant that Ashe was about to wake up. 

The red-headed boy came to see if Ashe was alright by entering her dream. However, what he didn't expect was that he would come upon a scene, which made him wonder if the dreams had another significant meaning aside from being dreams.

Ashe opened her eyes and found herself in a familiar room. She was still half asleep, but she could feel two sets of hands that were hugging her from her left and right sides.

"Do you feel anything strange?" William asked. "Are you hurting anywhere?"

Ashe's drowsiness faded away when she heard the concern in William's voice. It was as if the haze inside her mind was slowly clearing away and it made her think more clearly.

"My head just hurts a bit, but aside from that, I am fine," Ashe replied. "What happened to me? The last thing I remembered was going out of the Dungeon. I can't remember anything after that."

William sighed as he held her hand firmly. He was relieved that Ashe was only feeling a light headache and there were no severe side-effects from being possessed by a Demigod. 

"I'll tell you everything," William said softly.

He then narrated what happened after they left the Dungeon and came upon the City of Atlantis. William didn't hide anything and told Ashe the conversation he had with the Demigod. The Half-Elf didn't tell her anything about the dream because he didn't know if it was just a one time thing or not.

He planned to visit Ashe's dreams several times before he passed on his judgement on whether her dream was connected with Wendy's dream or just a coincidence. 

His Incubus Job Class was an incomplete version, so the powers that came with it were also not complete. The only time he would be able to use the power Dream Weaver, instead of Dream Walker, was when he had come of age and visited a Temple to talk with the Goddess Eros. 

Until then, William could only use his powers as an Incubus to subtly manipulate a dream and guide it to his intended result. The chances of this succeeding were not that high, but it was still better than being carried like a leaf on the river's surface.

Chapter 416

Two days had passed in the real world since William's encounter with Leviathan. He had anticipated that the dungeon floors of Atlantis would be quite vast, but he had no idea how vast they actually were. A day in the real world was equivalent to three days inside the Dungeon.

In those six days inside the dungeon, William's Herd and Legion had only managed to fully explore the first two floors. Just like he anticipated, the first Floor was only composed of slime type monsters. 

However, the true surprise was that there were some low-grade herbs that grew on the second floor of the dungeon. These herbs were quite common in the market, but Wililam didn't expect that such herbs would also grow inside a dungeon.

These herbs, when combined, could create minor healing potions. These healing potions were equivalent to one of William's red lollipops. Although its effect was minimal, having large quantities of these potions would be beneficial to him.

Additionally, these potions could be combined with the sap from the Dragon Blood Tree that was planted in his Domain, to create Greater Healing Potions with stronger healing effects. 

This was an unexpected boon to William so he assigned the Goblins to regularly collect these herbs and bring them to the Warehouse near his Villa inside the Thousand Beast Domain. 

Another thing that made William Happy was the system notification alerting him that his Goblin Crypt was now ready to receive an upgrade. 

After obtaining the Goblin Crypt, William became the Dungeon Master, which gave him full control over the dungeon. 

The system had also introduced a new feature to him called Dungeon Points. Each day the Goblin Crypt generated 100 Dungeon Points. These points allowed William to restructure the dungeon in any way that he wanted. He could add floors, traps, and even control the settings of the spawn rate of the Goblins inside the dungeon.

He also had the power to add new monsters that were suitable for the Goblin Crypt. The System also told William that the more floors a dungeon had, the more Dungeon Points it would generate on a daily basis.

Dungeon Points: 2,458

William tilted his head when he saw the current amount of Dungeon Points. According to his calculations, he should only have 200 Dungeon Points because the Daily Point reward only counted the days outside the dungeon. 

'System, why do I have a surplus of Dungeon Points?' William asked. He was quite happy that he had more than he expected. The reason he asked the System was to know where the points were coming from. 

< Host. It seems that we get 1 Dungeon Point for every monster we kill inside the Atlantis Dungeon. My theory is that whenever a Goblin kills something inside the Dungeon, it is automatically converted to Dungeon Points. >

'Doesn't this mean we can farm Dungeon Points if we unleash the entire Goblin Army on a mad killing spree?'

< Yes. Not only that, but the ranks of the Goblins will increase as they gain Experience Points. It is killing two birds with one stone! >

A devilish grin appeared on William's face as he explored the settings of the Goblin Crypt. He checked the monsters that could be added inside it. After a brief discussion with the System, they decided to tweak the spawn locations of the monsters inside the Goblin Crypt.

Each floor had a spawn limit. Meaning, there was a set number of Monsters that could spawn on a particular Dungeon floor. Once this limit was reached, no other monsters would spawn again, unless some of these monsters were killed.

After William and the System finished their brainstorming, they decided to add another floor to the Dungeon. The newly made 31st Floor would be the home of the Goblin Dogs. 

< Danderous Goblin Dogs >

-- Dungeon Creature

-- Threat Level: Class D (Mid)

-- Danderous Goblin Dogs are disease-ridden dogs that nobody wants to get in contact with. Their horrible smell and rabid bites make them one of the most annoying creatures that Adventurers don't want to engage unless it is as a last resort.

The reason why William chose the Danderous Goblin Dogs as the latest addition to the Goblin Army was because he wanted these dogs to serve as mounts for his Goblin Army. 

(A/N: Yes, it is Danderous and not Dangerous. It's a word play for the word Dander. Ask Google senpai for answers.)

Although they were only a meter tall right now, these dogs were capable of evolving into stronger beasts that were known as Scavenger Goblin Dogs that were a meter-and-a-half tall. This was a Class B Beast that was known for its quick movements over almost any terrain.

Lastly, it also had one final evolution called the Vicious Nether Hound, that made them Class A Beasts. These hounds were true bonafide predators that roamed within the plains of Hell. Standing over two-meters tall, they served as the war mounts of high-tiered Demons.

William currently didn't have the right Dungeon to evolve them to their final form. The Vicious Nether Hounds could only be born in the rich miasma that came from Hell. Then and only then would these powerful Demonic Dogs show their full potential.

With the Atlantis Dungeon right at their doorstep, William was sure that the Danderous Goblin Dogs would at least evolve to their second form, which was the Scavenger Goblin Dogs. This was the best that William could do in preparation for the war that he was about to participate in.

The cost of adding one Dungeon floor was worth 500 Dungeon Points. It cost an additional 1,500 Dungeon Points to make the Dungeon spawn twenty Goblin Dogs a day. William planned to increase the spawn rate of the 31st Floor after gathering more Dungeon Points from Atlantis.

Visit to lightnov‍elworld.c‌om discover_new novels.

He had seen the other Goblin Monsters that he could add inside his dungeon and he was quite interested in trying them out. One of them was the Goblin Paladin, which cost 1,000,000 Dungeon Points. 

The price was truly outrageous, but it allowed William to have a Powerful Goblin Sovereign that would be in the middle stages of the Millennial Rank.

'One step at a time,' William thought as he watched his Dungeon Points increase from time to time. Although 1,000,000 Dungeon Points was still far from his reach, he had no doubt that one day, his Powerful Goblin Army would make anyone tremble in their wake.




Chapter 417

William invested 500 God Points to buy five more Dragon Blood Trees to be planted in the Eastern side of the Thousand Beast Domain in order to mass-produce healing potions for the upcoming war.

Although he would continue to make lollipops, it would not be enough to cover every member of his army. This was why he prioritized the stockpiling of healing ingredients.

Aside from that, William bought two additional warehouses to store the other miscellaneous items that they would need for the war. These Warehouses cost one hundred God Points each. Although it was a bit costly for William's limited funds, he knew that they were needed so he bought them without batting an eye.

< Dragon Blood Tree - 100 God Points each. >

-- A breed of tree that produces a red sap that could be used for making healing potions.

God Points: 700

"We have arrows, and ingredients for healing potions," William muttered as he checked the inventory of the two warehouses that he had bought. "System, do you have any other recommendations?"

< We need weapons for the Goblin Army. Their weapons are very basic and are far inferior to the weapons of a regular army. >

William crossed his arms over his chest and nodded. The beast type monsters didn't need weapons because their bodies were their weapons. Unfortunately, the Goblin Army didn't have that leeway and needed to equip themselves with weapons in order to maximize their potential.

'Any suggestions?'

< We don't have enough God Points right now, but we can always raid the barracks of the Hellan Kingdom. They would definitely have weapons in them. >

William nodded. Although he was currently using the blacksmith skill to craft weapons for his army, they were just lower grade weapons that couldn't be compared to military grade weapons. 

However, William was still maximizing his Blacksmith Job Class because he wanted a day to come when the members of his Legion would be equipped with weapons that were of the same quality, if not higher than Barbatos' forged weapons.

The red headed boy sighed once again when he remembered the warm and kind hearted blacksmith of Lont. all of his early years had been crafted by Barbatos and they were of very high quality. 

'Okay, we now have a way to get weapons, is there anything else that we should focus on?'

< Food, water, and medicine. I don't know if the Atlantis Dungeon has beasts that could serve as food, since we have only explored the first three floors. Unfortunately, the local monsters are just blue slimes whose only purpose is to serve as a means to farm Dungeon Points. >

William nodded. Thanks to the great numbers of slimes that spawned in the Dungeon on a regular basis, he managed to add four more floors to the Goblin Crypt which brought its total dungeon floor count to thirty-five.

Each floor had a limit of five hundred Monsters. William had made all the five new dungeon floors spawn Danderous Goblin Dogs.

Currently, William had a hundred-ten Danderous Goblin Dogs which he had assigned to the Goblin Warriors to be used as Mounts. They were too small for the Hobgoblins to use as Mounts, so William had no choice but to assign the Goblin Warriors to mount them.

These Goblin Cavaliers were led by a Goblin Warrior, named Sharx, whom William had personally Knighted. The reason he chose this Goblin Warrior to lead them was due to a unique scar on its right cheek, which made it stand out from the other Goblin Warriors. 

After receiving the King Chess Piece's blessing, this Goblin Warrior had evolved into a Goblin Marauder and received the Prestige Class Scarred Doom Marauder. 

Not only that, its Danderous Goblin Dog Mount transformed into a Vicious Nether Hound, which almost made William drop Rhongomyniad in shock. 

William checked the information of the Third Official Knight of his King's Legion and nodded his head in appreciation.

Sharx the Goblin Marauder was a Class B (Mid) Monster, while its Mount, whom William named Sparky, was a Class A (Low) Monster.

The sudden change in their leader's features made all the Goblin Warriors look at William with starry eyes. Unfortunately, the King Chess Piece was not Omnipotent. After giving its blessing to Sharx, it went back to being dormant.

Even so, with the power of Rhongomyniad, he had turned the Goblin Warriors into Goblin Cavaliers, raising their ability for mounted combat. The Goblin Cavaliers were Class D (High) Monsters. 

William believed that after gaining experience points inside the Dungeon of Atlantis, these green-skinned cavaliers would soon step into the rank of Class C (Low) Monsters which would further boost William's army.

Aside from the Goblin Dogs, William also decided to use the Trollhounds, with the exception of Fenrir, as mounts for the Hobgoblin Leaders. He deemed that this strategy would increase their mobility in the battlefield and make them a more effective fighting force in battle.

New_chapters are published on lightnov‎elworld.c​om

As always, William blessed these Hobgoblin Leaders with Rhongomyniad, which allowed them to effectively use the Trollhounds as mounts as if they were part of their bodies, due to the power of the Union of Man and Beast.

These Goblin and Trollhound Cavaliers officially became William's light Cavalry units which were led by Sparky and Fenrir respectively.

Meanwhile somewhere in the Hellan Kingdom…

After spending two days of fruitless searching, Conner decided to return to their Headquarters to see if there were any updates from the other search parties that were now scouring the Hellan Kingdom for any signs of the Hidden Valley where the monument was enshrined.

"Sir, we still haven't found the Monument," Calum reported as he bowed his head.

He had been staying in their headquarters to serve as the person in charge of receiving the reports from the members of Deus. 

Conner sighed internally and nodded his head in acknowledgement. He knew that it was not going to be an easy task to find the Undying Lands in just a few days of searching.

The Leader of Deus in the Southern Continent hadn't placed all of The Organization's manpower into searching for the Hidden Valley. He also appointed several teams to spy on the movements of the Elves in the Zelan Dynasty. 

He was afraid that Alessio would become impatient and urge the Elves to attack the Hellan Kingdom while Conner was occupied with his mission. 

After sorting through the reports, Conner came upon an interesting development. A few days ago, the members of The Organization noticed over a hundred teenagers entering the borders of the Hellan Kingdom.

According to the scout of The Organization, whot used a familiar to observe the teeangers from afar, they were all bruised and battered and seemed to have encountered a battle with the Elves. 

The agent also added in his report that the children took some of the horses in the fortress and headed West. Since his duty was to observe the movements of the Elves, he didn't leave his post and just filed a report to their Headquarters so the higher-ups could decide what to do with the refugees that had entered their borders.

He had already expected such an outcome after the Elven invasion, so he wasn't too surprised by the report. However, what concerned Conner was that the refugees didn't head straight towards the capital, but instead, headed West.

Conner pondered for a bit before leaving some instructions to Calum to send some men to look for these refugees from the Zelan Dynasty.

"I will rest for a day before returning to the Hellan Capital," Conner said. "If there is any news about the Undying Lands, notify me right away."

"Yes, My Lord," Calum replied before bowing his head respectfully. 

Conner nodded and went to his chambers to rest.

A few minutes later, a small black snake slithered out of the room, undetected, before turning into a black mist. 

Ezio reappeared a safe distance away from the Headquarters of Deus. He had been monitoring their movements and had been on the lookout for the latest news within their chain of command.

After weighing the pros and cons, Ezio resolutely headed back to the capital of Gladiolus. Est was a close friend of William's and he didn't want the boy to come to harm. William had already told his Fourth Master that if The Organization returned to reclaim the capital, he should tell Dave and Conrad to take Est and Isaac to the Kyrintor Mountains.

Brendan had already become his Disciple and he was quite satisfied with the boy's aptitude. Having him become the puppet steward of the capital would help Ezio keep an eye on Conner, while he shifted his attention to other important matters.

Follow new_episodes on the lightnov‌elworld.c­om platform.

Matters that would help ease the burden of the red-headed boy who was doing his best to make ends meet.




Chapter 418

"Understood, Master," Brendan said with determination. "I will look after the capital while you are away."

Ezio nodded and patted his Second Disciple's shoulder. "I will keep in touch using the method that I told you about. Do not do anything reckless and do not look for me. I will find you when the time is right."

"Yes, Master."

"Farewell."

Ezio turned into a black mist and disappeared into the night. He had already informed Dave and Conrad about Conner's imminent arrival to the capital. Est and Isaac were currently helping the two boys take the crystal statues of Est's Mother, Herman, and Nana to the flying carriage.

Est didn't want to leave the people important to him behind and decided to bring them along. After safely loading the statues into the carriage, they immediately left the capital and headed North.

Ezio waited until the four boys had safely left the capital before heading South East. His destination was none other than the Zelan Dynasty where the Elves were staying. 

He would go there to gather information. Of course, if an opportunity presented itself, he would assassinate their Commander in order to bring chaos to their ranks. 

Ezio was quite familiar with the Elves. He had several missions within the Silvermoon Continent when Maxwell, William's father, was busy fighting against the Demons. Although he knew that not all Elves were hypocrites, more than half of them were.

This was especially true in regards to the Patriarchs of some of the Elven Clans who hated Humans to the bone.

True to his word, Conner arrived the next day bringing with him over a hundred subordinates. The first thing he did was summon Brendan and ask him what the son of the Prime Minister had done in his absence.

"After his Excellency left the capital, I looked for volunteers to gather the survivors that were suffering on the outskirts of the kingdom," Brendan reported. "Since we have plenty of food in the capital, It would be a shame to let them fend for themselves and die."

New novel_chapters are published here: lightnov‍elworld.c­om

Breandan's voice was filled with such patriotism and righteousness that Conner found it hard to find fault in his actions. Also, he had given the boy the authority to do whatever he wanted during his absence.

Although what Brendan did was troublesome, Conner had no issues with it.

'They can be used as additional hands during the war,' Conner mused before nodding his head. 

He was currently seated on the throne of the Hellan Kingdom, while Breandan was kneeling in front of him. 

"Continue gathering the survivors," Conner ordered. "Also, bring me the documents that pertain to the defensive capabilities of the capital. I will need all the information that you can give me."

Brendan pondered for a bit before giving his opinion. "Your Excellency, I think these documents can be found in the Ministry of War, and the Ministry of Public Works and Development. Your Excellency, I alone will not be able to search for the documents you are looking for."

Conner nodded in appreciation because Brendan was truly helpful when it came to managing the kingdom. 

"Very well. I will give you the manpower you need."

He then waved his hand and called out twenty of his subordinates to assist Brendan in finding the documents that he needed in order to strengthen the defenses of the capital. 

A few minutes after he left, the ring on his finger started to glow. Conner frowned as he activated the long distance communication device that was given to the leaders who were in charge of capturing the Kingdoms and Dynasties of the Southern Continent.

A few seconds after activating the ring, a projection appeared in front of him. The sounds of battle could be heard in the background as the anxious face of Conner's subordinate appeared in front of him.

"S-Sir! The capital of Anaesha Dynasty is being attacked! It's impossible to defend it," Conner's subordinate screamed as he rolled to the side to evade an arrow that landed in the place where he stood a while ago.

New_chapters are published on lightnov‎elworld.c‍om

"Who is attacking you?" Conner asked. He tried to keep his voice calm, but he was already clenching his fist so hard that his nails dug into his palms. "Is it the Elves?"

"N-No! It's the Kraetor Empire and the Ant Army!" Conner's subordinate replied.

He was about to say more, but a three-meter tall ant descended on him from behind, forcing the man to take defensive actions.

The ant screeched as it spat a corrosive acid on the man that led Deus in the Anaesha Dynasty. A blood-curdling scream filled with pain and agony reverberated throughout the room as Conner's subordinate got hit by the Ant's attack.

Moments later, the man fell on the ground, dropping the communication crystal in his hand.

Conner watched as his subordinate turned into a pool of blood as the corrosive acid melted his entire body. The leader of Deus sighed helplessly as one of his trusted aides died in front of him. 

He was about to cut the connection when he noticed a white, and slender, hand pick the communication crystal up off the ground. Conner's eyes widened when he came face to face with a beauty that could bring the downfall of a nation.

Although this was the first time he had seen this beautiful lady, he still had a hunch about who she was.

Conner narrowed his eyes as he asked the girl who was looking at him with a devilish smile a question.

"Princess Sidonie?" Conner inquired.

Princess Sidonie nodded, "You must be Conner. I've heard a lot of things about you."

The beautiful girl's hazel eyes glowed with power as she looked through the crystal. Conner felt his breath grow ragged as he stared at those beautiful clear-eyes that could bring any man to their knees.

The source of this_chapter; lightnov‍elworld.c‌om

If not for the fact that Sidonie was only looking at Conner through a communication crystal, the Leader of Deus might have already been Charmed by now. 

Conner used all of his willpower to shake off the feeling of infatuation that was slowly taking hold of his body. He had long heard of Princess Sidonie's ability to Charm others, but he didn't expect that it was strong enough to affect him through a communication crystal!

This was something completely unheard of and it filled him with dread.

"Princess, it is a pleasure to finally meet you face to face," Conner said as he tried to keep his expression calm. "I know that both of us started off on the wrong foot, but it is not too late for us to negotiate a cooperation."

"Oh? A negotiation?" Princess Sidonie smiled sweetly. "Then, what do you have in mind, Mr. Conner?"

Princess Sidonie was wearing dark-blue light armor. It was the ceremonial armor for the Royal Family of Freesia and Princess Sidonie donned it in order to participate in the conquest of the Anaesha Capital. With the help of the Kraetor Empire and the Ant Warriors, the members of the Organization didn't stand a chance.

Their defenses immediately crumbled and the majority of them fled for their lives. Naturally, Sidonie didn't care whether they lived or died and simply ordered the Soldier Ants to do whatever they wanted to do.

Now that the leader of Deus in the Anaeshian Capital was dead, Princess Sidonie was now its official ruler.

"Our true enemy are the Elves," Conner stated. "The two of us don't need to fight."

"A tempting offer, but I still haven't forgotten that your men tried to capture me."

"I am open for negotiations. The Crown Prince who ordered your capture is currently being detained in our Headquarters. If you want, I can give him to you in order to appease your anger. Naturally, I am also prepared to pay an additional compensation if you wish."

The corner of Princess Sidonie's lips curled up into a smirk as she stared at the Half-Elf in front of her. He reminded her of the red-headed boy who had repeatedly rejected her advances.

A devious plan formed inside Princess Sidonie's head, which made her other half Morgana laugh out loud.

Yes, a plan that would make a certain red-headed boy accept her version of love. 




Chapter 419

"Very well. Send the Crown Prince to me and I will turn a blind eye on our grievances of the past," Princess Sidonie replied. "As for your proposal for an alliance… that will depend on what he will think."

Conner frowned. "He?"

"Yes." Princess Sidonie. "My… acquaintance. Are you familiar with the young Knight Commander, Sir William Von Ainsworth?"

Conner remembered Calum's report that he had seen William and the Princess together at Antheilm. Based on his subordinate's report, it seemed that the two of them had a good relationship with each other.

As to what the extent of their relationship was, Calum didn't know. However, the Princess' attitude towards the boy made him think that they were close to each other.

"What about him?" Conner inquired. "Is he perhaps your lover?"

Conner asked his last question in a teasing tone, but to his surprise, the Princess' smile stiffened when she heard his words. However, Princess Sidonie quickly regained her composure and answered his question.

"Sir William and I have a Non-Aggression Pact," Princes Sidonie replied. "If you form an alliance with him then I will not step foot on the borders of the Hellan Kingdom."

"Oh?" Conner raised an eyebrow. 

He had a deal with Celine that he wouldn't touch the Half-Elf if she didn't turn on them. So far, Celine had kept her distance and hadn't involved herself in the affairs of The Organization. Although she didn't help them with the Continental Spell, she didn't get in their way either.

Celine was an important asset to their Organization and, if possible, Conner wanted to keep it that way.

"I'll consider it," Conner stated after careful consideration. "I will send the Crown Prince to you shortly. I'll even throw his brother, Prince Rufus, in as a freebie. In return, please spare my subordinates and let them return to my side. I will also send additional compensation when we deliver the two Princes to you, Your Highness."

Princess Sidonie nodded her head. "Very well. I will spare your men. Also, as a sign of good faith, I will also not attack the Hellan Kingdom for two months. Naturally, if you can convince Sir William to ally with you then we can form a Non-Aggression Pact indefinitely."

Princess Sidonie then gave Conner a smile sweet enough to rot his teeth. 

"Thank you for your mercy, Your Highness." Conner gave a brief bow. "I will try to reach out to Sir William and negotiate with him."

"Good. I'll keep this communication stone, so tell me when you have succeeded in convincing him."

"Very well."

Princess Sidonie gave Conner a playful wink before cutting off the connection. 

Conner released a long deep sigh after his conversation with Princess Sidonie ended. With this, he had secured the lives of his men. Also, if he could prevent the Kraetor Empire from attacking the Hellan Kingdom, he could focus all of his attention on the Elves that he hated the most.

"William Von Ainsworth," Conner muttered as he activated a different ring in his hand. This ring allowed him to communicate with Calum who was currently stationed at their Headquarters.

He ordered him to send men to William's hometown, Lont, to look for his whereabouts. He added that if he was not there, they should look for Celine and ask her if she knew where her Disciple was.

Conner also didn't hide anything from his most trusted subordinate and told him about his conversation with the Princess. Calum listened patiently and waited for Conner to finish before giving a suggestion.

"Sir, I think that we should ask Celine to act as an intermediary to have a dialogue with the boy," Calum proposed. "This way, our chances of convincing him will be higher."

Conner pondered for a while as he eyed his right-hand man with approval. It was indeed a good proposal, however, there was one thing that might hinder the negotiation from pushing through.

'We don't know how the boy will react if he finds out that we are the ones responsible for turning the adults into crystal statues,' Conner thought. 'Also, I don't think Celine wants him to know that she is a member of The Organization.'

A sinister smile appeared on Conner's face as he thought about what William's reaction would be when he discovered that his Master was one of the members of The Organization that had turned the continent upside down.

Conner was faced with another choice. Should he look for William without consulting Celine and use the fact that the Half-Elf's Master was a member of The Organization to coerce him to join their ranks?

Or, should he just let Celine talk to the boy in their stead? Either way, the boy and his Master would have a falling out, which would be beneficial to their Organization.

"For now, search for the boy's whereabouts without looking for Celine," Conner ordered. "If you don't find him within a week, send some men to Lont and let them look for her."

"Understood." Calum nodded in understanding. 

Although he had concerns in regards to Berthold being part of the Kraetor Army, he didn't give him too much importance. 

As leaders of the Organization, Conner knew more than anyone else that Berthold didn't hold the final say in the Kraetor Army. As long as the Princess was on his side, the leader of the Organization stationed in the Kraetor Empire couldn't do anything reckless that might jeopardize his position.

Conner wanted to exploit the Princess to prevent Berthold from making moves against him. For him, this was the perfect plan to lower the number of enemies that he had to fight in the future. 

Princess Sidonie giggled as she placed the communication crystal inside her storage ring. Several young knights of the Kraetor Empire stood around her in a daze as they waited for her orders. 

Prince Jason felt the danger of being around his Cousin and stayed far away from her reach. He had already thought of forming a close relationship with her, with the intention of asking for her hand in marriage.

However, he didn't intend to become one of her mindless slaves that would cater to her every whim. Prince Jason glanced at Princess Sidonie from afar and felt the blood boil in his veins. He had already conquered the hearts of many women in the Kraetor Empire and had enjoyed their affection and their bodies.

The latest_episodes are on_the lightnov‍elworld.c‍om website.

Still, Princess Sidonie's allure was too strong for him to resist.

'I want to conquer her,' Prince Jason thought. 'I want to pin her down on my bed and hear her beg for me to shower her with my love and affection.'

Prince Jason had done this numerous times in the past. His feelings for Princess Sidonie soared as he licked his lips in anticipation. 

It was quite unfortunate that the moment he laid his eyes on the Princess, the power of Lust had already seeped deep inside his heart. 

Even though he was wearing protective artifacts to prevent himself from being fully Charmed by Princess Sidonie's power, they were unable to stop the subtle workings of the power of Lust in the young Commander's state of mind.

As one of the Seven Deadly Sins that stood at the Apex, Lust was the most primitive power of all. Under Princess Sidonie's gaze, even the most disciplined and proud Monks, who practiced celibacy, would perform the most depraved carnal acts in order to win her smile.

Feeling Prince Jason's fiery gaze, the Princess turned her head to look at him. Deep inside her Mindscape, Morgana was laughing her heart out. 

"Darling, you will regret turning us down," Morgana said after laughing. "You should have just accepted our love back then. If you had, you would have already been the Emperor of this Continent. Still… it is more interesting this way, isn't that right, Sidonie?"

Princess Sidonie nodded her head as she hugged her other half. "It's strange. This feeling of wanting to conquer someone, I've never felt this feeling before."

"Good." Morgana returned Sidonie's hug and kissed her lips. "Let's compromise. I'll let you have Darling first then I'll have him give birth to our babies at a later time."

Princess Sidonie smiled. The image of the handsome Half-Elf, kneeling in front of her while licking her feet, awoke the sadistic nature that was sleeping deep inside her.

"I look forward to that day, Big Sister," Princess Sidonie cupped the side of Morgana's face. "Please, do your best to make our Prince… love us with all of his heart."

"I will," Morgana said as her eyes glowed with power. She, too, couldn't wait to get her hands on William. The thrill of conquering the arrogant, and narcissistic Half-Elf made Morgana's Lustful Heart... skip a beat.




Chapter 420

"William, we need to talk," Oliver said as he sat on the branch of the Dragon Blood Tree.

William was crafting Healing Potions using the Yin Yang Cauldron, which also increased the level of his Alchemist Job Class. William wiped away the sweat on his forehead as he finished making the last batch of healing potions. 

"Give me one more minute, Second Master," William said as he cleaned the Yin Yang Cauldron. He used a water spray to rinse it out before using the Flames of Purification to dry it. 

William looked at the Cauldron and nodded his head in approval. Although he couldn't consider himself as a full-fledged Alchemist, the Yin Yang Cauldron had made alchemy very easy for him. All he needed to do was toss in the ingredients, control his Flames of Purification, and allow the Cauldron to do its magic.

After finishing his task, William returned the Cauldron to his storage ring and looked up at his Second Master, who was looking at him with a serious expression. The Half-Elf knew that whenever Oliver had this look on his face, he was about to tell him something very important.

"What do you want to talk about, Second Master?" William inquired as he leaned against the Dragon Blood Tree to rest.

Oliver cleared his throat as if he was thinking of the right way to initiate their conversation. Half a minute later, the Parrot Monkey sighed as he looked down on the boy who had closed his eyes to rest.

"It's about the organization, Deus, that is responsible for casting the Continental Spell," Oliver said. "My Mistress, Celine, is a member of their Organization."

A minute of silence passed as Oliver waited for William's reaction to his revelation. He knew that the boy was planning to have a head-on-collision with The Organization, so he decided to tell him that Celine was part of their group.

Finally, after several more minutes of silence, William opened his eyes.

"Second Master, did Master take part in the spell that turned Grandpa and the others into Crystal Statues?" William inquired.

William used a calm and neutral tone to ask this question. However, Oliver was able to feel the subtle rise in his voice as he said the last word.

"No," Oliver answered firmly. "The Mistress didn't participate in the Organization's plan to turn everyone into Crystal Statues. In fact, she was the one that told your Grandpa and the others that The Organization was scheming something. Unfortunately, they didn't tell her all of the details on the off chance that she might divulge the plan to others."

William released a deep, long, sigh after hearing Oliver's words. He felt relieved that Celine didn't take part in the creation of the Continental Spell. The Half-Elf knew that he would find it hard to forgive Celine if she played a role in the spell that turned his loved ones into statues.

She still owed him a debt from when she turned him into her slave. A debt that he was planning to make her pay in the future. However, if Celine had taken part in the creation of the Continental Spell, he would break all ties with her and treat her as an enemy.

"Did Master tell you to tell me this? ?" William inquired. 

Oliver shook his head. "I did this without consulting the Mistress. This was an independent action on my part."

William closed his eyes as he organized his thoughts. His Master wasn't someone who liked to make her thoughts known to him. Although he was still on the fence about her being a part of The Organization he was planning to fight, he knew that Celine would never do anything to hurt him.

William frowned as he pondered Oliver's words.

'All of the important adults know about her involvement with the organization, and Lont has used this to their advantage many times,' Will thought as he rubbed his chin. 'So there is tact silent approval? There must be more to this that I don't know.'

A few more minutes passed in silence before William finally spoke out his mind.

"Second Master, can I believe you?"

"You can."

"Is there a reason behind why Master joined the organization?" William asked.

"Of course. However, you need to ask her what the reason is," Oliver replied. "I do not have the right to tell you why Mistress decided to join them."

William nodded his head in understanding. He also felt that it was wrong to ask this question to Oliver, so he decided to put this matter aside until he reunited with Celine once again.

"Second Master, I won't ask for the reason why Master joined The Organization. But, can you answer a question for me?"

"It depends on the question, Little Will. There are some questions that I can't answer."

William stared at the scenery of his Domain before asking the question he had in mind.

"What is the goal of this Organization?" William asked. 

To his surprise, Oliver chuckled as he sat on the branch of the Dragon Blood Tree. 

"Revenge," Oliver replied. "The Organization's goal is to take revenge on those that have wronged them. It exists solely for this reason."

"Revenge…," William muttered the words absentmindedly as he stared into the distance. He knew that Celine had suffered a lot during her childhood. Although Oliver hadn't explicitly told him the reason why Celine joined the organization, the hint he gave was more than enough for William to form his own conclusion.

"Understood. I'll have a proper talk with Master the next time we meet."

"Okay."

Oliver knew that this was William's way of reaching a compromise. The Parrot Monkey sighed because he felt like a great burden had been removed from his shoulders. 

He had an internal debate with himself a few days ago about whether or not he should tell William the truth. In the end, he decided that he would rather be the one to break this news to William than let others tell him lies. 

Lionheart screeched as he landed on the ground. It was almost sunset, so Dave decided to let him rest before continuing their journey towards the Kyrintor Mountain.

Conrad's Wyvern landed not far away from the Gryphon. Both Knights removed the harnesses that bound their partners and allowed them to hunt for their prey.

Est and Isaac disembarked from the carriage to stretch their bodies. Although the flying carriage was comfortable enough, they still felt stiff after sitting and lying all day long.

"How many more days will it take before we reach the Kyrintor Mountains?" Est asked Dave after he finished making a campfire. 

Isaac was already preparing to cook their dinner, so Est had nothing to do except to wait for his trusted retainer to finish his task.

"One more day," Dave replied. "Head Prefect, have you visited the Kyrintor Mountains before?"

"No." Est shook his head. "But, I've heard many stories about them. Is it true that all the warriors of the Northern Tribes have skin as hard as steel?"

"No." Dave chuckled.

The Kyrintor Mountains had always been a very mysterious place. Very few people from the Hellan Kingdom had visited the mountains. Since no information was readily available, those who liked gossip started to make up stories of their own.

Some of the rumors regarding the Kyrintor Mountains involved their warriors being over two meters tall and that they had skin as hard as steel. Dave had also heard of these rumors in the past and believed them.

If not for the fact that he had actually been to the mountains himself, he would probably still believe the rumors that were flying around in the capital.

Est looked towards the North, that was now shrouded in the darkness of the night. Deep inside he was looking forward to reuniting with William so he could beat him up for leaving him behind in the capital!

While he was in charge, he had received a letter from Spencer that his sister, Wendy, had joined William in his travels. This news made Est grind his teeth because he felt that he was being excluded from the group. 

Still, the thought of the Half-Elf traveling all over the kingdom to gather allies who would fight for them made some of the resentment in his heart disappear. He knew that William was someone who treasured the people important to him.

Est wouldn't admit it, but he felt jealous of Ian because she had found a way to unseal the curse on her body. Although it only lasted for a few hours, it was enough for the beautiful mermaid to do intimate things with the Half-Elf whom he'd liked for many years.

Est sighed as he unconsciously pressed his two hands over his chest and groped them. 

'I wonder if they will become as big as Celine's when I grow up and the curse is lifted,' Est thought. 'William mentioned back in Lont that he liked girls with big breasts…'

Est was so lost in his thoughts that he didn't notice that Dave and Conrad were looking at him weirdly. Isaac, who also saw this scene, averted his gaze. 

Although he didn't know what his Young Master was thinking, Isaac could still make a guess. After all, he knew that Est loved William, just as much as his twin loved the boy.

'Love sure makes people become weird,' Isaac thought. 'I'd better not fall in love with anyone. That way, I can look after the Young Master and my twin and prevent them from doing stupid things.'

Isaac made this vow inside his heart as he focused on his task of preparing dinner. Although he liked William as a friend, he couldn't see himself developing any romantic feelings for him. He was content on supporting Ian and Est from the sidelines as they stayed with the man whom both of them had loved for the past few years.
